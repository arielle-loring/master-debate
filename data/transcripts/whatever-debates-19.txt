She's also a self-described leftist, feminist, anti-racist, LGBTQ activist. The topic today is feminism. You will each have up to a uh 10-minute opening statement. And then the rest of the show will just be open conversation with some prompt changes and breaks for messages from the audience followed by each of you having a closing statement. Kylie, you're going to go first. Go ahead. Okay. Thank you. Um, hi, my name is Kylie. I just wanted to start by saying a little bit about what I stand for, which is just feminism generally. And I would want to say that feminism is a crucial movement both in the United States and across the world. Feminism is defined as advocating for gender equality and challenging the structures of power that perpetuate discrimination and violence against women. It is not an attack on men. Rather, it is a call for an equal and just society. In the US, despite progress, women face systemic inequalities, which means that gender inequality is rooted in many of the systems that we see today. For instance, women in the US earn 82 cents for every dollar that a man makes and black women earn just 63 cents. So, there are three reasons potentially that this could be the case, which is I would say that we do not value female labor enough in this country. And there's a phenomenon called male flight which is typically when a field becomes very female dominated 50 to 60% women men typically begin to leave that field and the pay rate for women drops. So that might be some sort of implicit phenomenon happening as well as domestic labor is unpaid which is when women typically take on more of the child rearing in homes and obviously that is not something that is compensated. And for women who do go to work and raise kids, there's inadequate child support, meaning they often miss out on we often miss out on promotions or other major um opportunities in the career because we are not supported in that way. So this all could explain that economic inequality. Which brings me to according to the World Economic Forum, it's going to take roughly 300 years to close the gender gap for both economic and political empowerment for women. In countries like Afghanistan, women still battle for access to education and health care as well as personal freedoms. In some places, if they open the door without being covered, they may be beaten or arrested. Which brings me to this. The home is the most dangerous place for women. According to the United Nations, the home, the place where we should all feel safe. Six women are killed every hour around the world by people they know. Now, here are some other very depressing statistics. One in three women experience violence at the hands of a man in their lifetime, whether that's physical or SA. And that's according to the World Health Organization. 50% of women who were unalived in 2017 were killed by an intimate partner violence. It's according to the United Nations. 650 million women were married before the age of 18. This is according to UNICEF, meaning they became child brides, often against their will. Now the final statistic is that 71% of human trafficking victims are women and girls. This is not to negate the importance of male victims and standing up for their rights as well. Just to point out a general pattern in the fact that women are typically um overlooked as well as over represented in victim being victims of crimes. Now, there's also a general tendency to blame women for our oppression. That we make less because our work is less important, or because we choose to work in fields that don't pay as much money, or that we were essayed because of the clothes we were wearing, or that we were unalived because we chose to marry the wrong man. But none of these things are true, and they are rooted in really harmful misconceptions about what the feminist movement stands for. I'm sure you all are also expecting me to be very angry today. And I hope that I won't be. But I'm truly interested in furthering the feminist cause and promoting equality, even if it means sometimes talking to people who don't agree with me. Um, and finally, I just would like to say that men can be feminists and they're very important for the feminist movement for seeking equal rights um around the world. And um we strive to combat hate, not promote it, for equal rights for all. And by definition, feminism is about the belief in social, economic, and political equality of the sexes, not about female supremacy or anything like that. And I hope to debunk some of the myths that people think about feminists today and show that it is very important cause, not just globally, but in the US and in the West. Thank you. All right, Kylie, thank you very much for your opening statement. Uh Andrew, if you'd like to give yours now. Yeah. Um just a second. Let me back up here. One thing I wanted to address right in my opening. I've been going through Kylie's videos and she knows so much which is not. So this is a big bait and switch. This happens often. I think I pointed this out to the whatever podcast many times especially when it comes to sociology and psychology. How often they are wrong. And here's how they're wrong. Most often what they do is they take studies which are recently published. They point to those data sets and say because this is right now the most current data set we have it's true and then operate as though those things are in reality true when they're not. Kinsey says for instance on gender quotas according to and she she cites this and many feminists site this are you talking about the the Kinsey study? Yeah. Yeah. The Kinsey study which you cite right and most feminists site the Kinsey study um has been debunked for years. I don't know where why why feminist Hang on. It's my opening statement. You'll have a chance to cross-examine him. Just allow him to let me let me walk you through this. Earlier this week, journalist Christopher Brunette flagged a paper in a March 2024 issue of Econ Journal Watch, a bannual publication edited by George Mason economist Daniel Klene that publishes, articles, lengths, responses to other economist errors. The paper written by accounting professor Jeremiah Green of Texas A&M and John RM Hand of the University of North Carolina addressed the first of three McKenzie four installment series of diversity studies. Green and Hand sought to test the replicability of McKenzie's findings. Guess what they found, guys? Could another set of researchers using the same data come to the same conclusions? Since uh McKenzie refused to turn over its numbers, Green and Hand had to reverse engineer the firm's 2015, 18, and 20 data sets. The results were startling. Green in hand couldn't replicate the results of McKenzie's first three studies, which monitored the profitability of executive demographics of an undisclosed group of S&P 500 firms claiming to have found a positive correlation between diverse leadership and the firm's performance. We do not find a statistical significant positive correlation between um McKenzie's measures of the racial ethnic diversity of executive terms of firms as measured in December 2019 green and hand reported and either the likelihood of financial outperformance in 1519. So to give you a quick summary, the study seems to show it's most likely correlation and not causation, meaning companies were already doing very financially well. Uh and they have the luxury to mess around with diversity quotas and initiatives. In addition, the data from the 2024 paper was unable to replicate any of the older McKenzie studies, any of them. That should uh tell you something. So that's a very recent data set, right? Why don't any of the psychologists ever go with the recent data set? Well, the reason they don't go with it is because it doesn't affirm their nonsensical worldviews. That's why they don't go with them ever. You'll find this very common in sociology and in psychology which suffer from the replication crisis. Somewhere around 60% of their findings cannot be replicated are not to be trusted. Psychology is the study of the mind. The scientific views of psychology are only done through data collection. But it has to be interpreted. This is a major major problem. So many feminists will tell you so many studies and luckily I have all of the ones to refute all of all of my opponent's studies today because what happens is they have a biased worldview and they want the data set to correlate with the worldview rather than wanting to tell you what the actual truth is. The truth is is that a bunch of S&P 500 companies who are very rich were already doing really well. And for the purposes of publicity, they decided that they were going to start doing a bunch of DEI hires and ethnic hires and this type of thing. And they decided that the correlation co they made it the correlation causation error. That's it. You'll find this over and over again, I'm sure, as we go through this debate, as we go through the numbers, especially when it comes to the abuse of women, especially when it comes to just how useful women are. We talk about domesticated labor labor. What a joke. You believe that women should be paid some type of domestic wage. However, it's skilled labor in the home which keeps the home running. It's always going to be paid way more than domestic labor because it's more worthwhile than domestic labor. Simple. So, with that, I'll finish my opening statement. I can't wait to dive right into this. Okay. Uh, so Kylie, it sounded like you maybe had some uh some push back you wanted to give on something Andrew said there. Yeah, so I um very briefly referenced the McKenzie study and Mackenzie and company's women in the workplace study by the way is what he's referring to. But um it's actually if you go and look it up, it's generally considered accurate and comprehensive in its findings. So, I have quite literally no idea what my opponent is talking about. As well as the fact that this is a red herring fallacy of just, oh, this is wrong and my opponent is wrong for the following reasons. How's that a red herring? Because you're not actually acknowledging any of the information that I said. I refuted the information. I didn't even talk about that. I have reputations to your video. I have your video right here. And you start by saying the largest comprehensive study, the Kinsey study. Which one are you talking about? I'll play it for you. Give me a second here. Okay. Well, um I think we should stick to what we're talking about today. Um and I just Well, we're talking about all of this today. So, the Okay. Well, I would like you to be less hostile to me first of all because I think we should just have a general discussion. Stop whining. We're doing a debate. Stop whining. So, um I'm not going to give you the reaction that I know you're looking for. Yeah. So, women are better leaders than most. You agree? Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I was looking at that video. Yeah. There. I mean, that's like one of the ones that Can you cite which study you Oh, yeah. The one that I'm talking about now, but I didn't reference that in my opening at all. So, I think the people in the audience, if they had any sort of common sense following along, they'd be like, "What is he talking about? Kylie didn't mention that." Which I didn't. But the thing is is like this is a a current core part of your worldview and belief and you make propaganda videos about it, even though it's completely uninformed that women are better leaders. I think that is a subjective opinion. None of the statistics and facts that I gave previously are objective opinions. Like the fact that women didn't have the right to vote until 1920, women couldn't open a bank account in the United States till 197. When did men get the right to vote? Okay, I know this exa is exactly what you were talking about. This is what you're known for is like getting people on a technicality that we don't historically know. But the answer to that is no. The answer to that is The answer is that's no. No. The answer to that is the fact that in 1920 everyone was given the right to vote, but there were still um barriers to vote for people of color. When did men get the right to vote? The the right to vote was guaranteed to all people in 1920 according to the 1920. Yeah. Before 1920, were men were all men allowed to vote? No. Okay, great. They weren't. Then when even when men supremacy and because our system was not founded equally. Are you aware that men only got any rights to vote about a decade roughly before women? That is not true. Men have been making the founding fathers were all men. So I have no idea what you're talking about. What does it have to do with the right to vote? The right to vote was historically withheld from men of color. It was a white also with the general population. Do not cut me off. Do not cut me off. I'm in the middle of speaking. I don't care if you're in the middle of speaking. You're in the middle of a debate. The right to to vote. You don't have your Tik Tok mute button, sweetheart. I will not be speaking anymore until you have a conversation with him. Well, look, if you can if we can uh for for both people, if we can allow each other to finish uh even if you want to jump in, just let the other person finish speaking. If somebody's going on a uh monologue and they're filibustering, I'll try to get them to wrap up, but just if they're making a point, just try to let them finish. No, I did not go to school for 4 years and build a platform to be talked to like this. So, I will be walking away from the microphone right now and I would encourage you to get your guest under control. I'm going to take two minutes so you can ask him questions if you'd like and I will be right back. I just won't be back. And I don't give a [ __ ] What do I care? I'm here to have a debate and I listen to your whining. Do you want to have a debate or not? All right. I I'm not going to be talked to like this. So, do you want Do you want to just take a little two-minute breather? You want to take a two-minute breather? This is feminism. You're the strong woman. You're the strong woman. Really? Strong woman. I will not be talked to. Like what? What did I even say? Um, you know, I would uh I will not be talked to like that. Yeah, you will. What are you talking about? What are you It's a debate. Maybe we'll we we can try to stick to there's been some really strong feminist women in that chair who have debated with me. Just not this one. Yeah. Um although I think maybe for the the sake of the ensuring that the debate happens. Uh maybe we can just so we get the debate so the debate happens. You know, maybe Well, what what am I supposed to do? I'm in the middle of a debate. Am I supposed am I supposed to worry about tone policing and this and that because I have points and reputations which may hurt people's feelings. Well, I I think she overreacted a little bit, but I think it is fair to allow uh then if she's in the middle of uh time it. Give us 60 seconds a piece. Uh yeah, we could do that. Yeah, I'll I'll propose that to her. Just do 60 seconds. But I mean, I'm I'm fine with keeping it open, but just if if you're talking, I'll and she interrupts you, I'll tell her not to. Mhm. But if you can, just try to let her uh finish. Yeah. But when they when when anybody does the [ __ ] of like I'm speaking, then you know what I mean? Of course, there's going to be some Yeah. But try to try to let her finish if you can. But yeah, let's do 60-second back and forth. That's fine with me. As long as there's some boundaries. Yeah. You want to do that? 60 seconds back and forth. That works. Or if you guys want, we could give it another shot at just keeping it open combo. Um, sure. Why don't we do that? If it if it the interruptions continue, you guys feel like you're not I would like to just point out that Wait, wait, wait. We have to set the rules first. No more talking. Yes, we will do 60 seconds. Supposed to be talked to like that though, right? No. 60 seconds back and forth. I Well, I will leave. I'm so serious. We sign an agreement. If I appear, you can leave. I don't care. Why do you think I care if you [ __ ] I'm not talking to you. Hold on. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking What's your What's Go ahead. What's your proposal? My proposal, if we don't do 60 seconds back and forth, I will walk out right now. The agreement was that I appear. It does not say that I have to stay for 3 hours. So, I will leave right now because I'm not going to be talked to like this. I mean, like what? What? Real men. A real You're going to tell me what a real man is? Well, Andrew, real women don't abort their children, lady. My dad has the same political beliefs as you, and he would never talk to a woman. My sister has the same political beliefs as you, and she would never dare talk to a man like that. Like, what's your point? That makes no sense. Andrew, can you stop? Andrew, that's really further. Oh god, if everything's disrespectful. Andrew, stop. Stop. You're such a crybaby. Andrew, stop. In furtherance of ensuring that this debate actually occurs, let's set some ground rules. We got to allow people to finish their points. And uh Andrew, maybe you've said some mocking things towards her. I have said no. I have not mocked him at all. No, no, no. I have stood up for myself and I will not be mocked. I have not said a word that is bad to you. I talked to you about your family in Michigan. I want to get to know you. This isn't about anything about me mocking you. This is a boundary of get to know you. I'm here to do a debate. Look, when you return to the table, uh you did the the tone your tone wasn't the best towards Andrew. And look look on hold on hold on. I'll be fair. Hold on, Kylie. I'll be fair. Andrew's tone towards you wasn't great either. in furtherance of ensuring that the debate actually occurs, why don't we just get back to it and stick to the uh the substance of the conversation. I'm trying to be fair to both of you, but 60 seconds each. Yeah. No interruptions. Andrew, if you if you're fine with that, then I'm fine with that. So, we'll and if you guys are open to it, if if that goes well, the 60 seconds each, we can bring it back to open conversation. Well, there does have to be some cross-examination at some point, but yeah, that's fine. Sure. Okay. So, Kylie, go ahead. You have uh 60 seconds. Okay. So, the point of my conversation here is I would genuinely like to have an open discussion about like what feminism means and to debunk some of the feminist myths, but my opponent seems to want to attack me instead and call me names, which is totally okay. I'm used to that. Um especially if you look at my comments online. But the point being, I'm going to try my best to keep it very mellow. Again, if I'm being attacked, I am going to get defensive. But I would like to start by saying yes, the Mackenzie study so in sociology, psychology studies are flawed and that is true. Um, they are continually it's a field that's expanding and that's why I chose to study psychology because I do find it so interesting. But that doesn't negate the fact that plenty of studies have found a significant correlation between being a woman and being a victim of violence at the hands of a man. And again, the study of one in three women globally who experience sexual or physical violence. And I think that is the core of what a lot of feminists believe in is trying to combat that violent behavior and to protect women. I'm sure that's close to a minute, so I can pass it over. Yeah. So, feminism has completely lied to everybody. And I'll explain exactly how. It failed in its promise. Its promise was that it was supposed to protect women. It hasn't protected women. The very idea that you want to put women inside of of male workforces is not protecting women. The idea that you want to have dual colleges where it's men and women together is not protecting women. These are terrible ideas and they've been borne out as being terrible ideas. When you talk about sociological studies being flawed, I don't think that you're really being honest about how flawed they are. The replication crisis in sociology is getting worse, not better. It's not getting better. Even with all the meta analysis, it's not getting better. Why isn't it getting better? It's because of bias. There's so much bias which is going on, especially from the the purview of feminists. And feminists use standpoint theory. They want everything to go through the view of women. So when you're talking about for instance the criteria when you're talking about uh what that means that women are assaulted right what what is the criteria for that for what an assault actually is? That's a really good question. Um it it there are definitely we are definitely working on um defining the lines for that. So right now there's an acronym that we are coming up with that we want to teach in schools of like what that means which is um fry. So freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic or engaged in specific of what consent means. So that there is no confusion about what is happening in terms of, you know, like whether it's an assault because I know that does happen where men are confused and they don't know and especially if there's alcohol involved. And so my goal is to protect women and also to make sure that men know that if they are causing harm that I mean a lot of men, they don't want to hurt other people. They don't realize it. And so I think if we have better education about like what assault is and how to prevent it because again there are male victims. So I think if it's something that we can come forward about and make sure that everyone feels heard and supported then men would also come forward more about like if they've been assaulted. This doesn't answer my question though. My question is when you cite the data on how many of these women have actually been assaulted, what is the criteria being used? Um that's a good question. I see your point of how it varies like based upon the study and things like that. But um I think uh a lot of these problem is that it is self-reported. But again another issue is that that means they could be under reportported as well because you know women are too scared to report it. Um so yes there are issues with that. Um but another thing though is that women are definitely in a position um in the home where they are not safe in a lot of places. And again that comes back to the um kind of assumption that I was talking about earlier is that like it's because we married the wrong man and you know this guy is unsafe in our home. But it's not about that. Sometimes when you you marry somebody or you date somebody, they can then become violent towards you um because they see you as their property almost. Most of these domestic violence claims and things like this are happening from single mothers with boyfriends though, not happening from the father at home relationships. Yes, I do. Okay. No, I I'm just wondering because um yeah, not only not only is that factually the case, but interestingly enough, if the state seizes custody of a child inside of an abusive home, the child's actually more likely at the hands of the state to die than they are in the hands of the abusive home, which is insane, but true, I think. Now, let me give you the studies that you're talking about here. Okay. Um I So, okay. Are are these the studies about which claims that you said? Yeah. So here we're going to start with the national incident study NIS. It's the largest collection of all types reporting data relating to abuse and m malreatment of children. Okay. 68% of malreated children were maltreated by a female whereas 48% were maltreated by a male. Some children were maltreated by both. Of children maltreated by biological parents. Mothers maltreated the majority 75% were fathers maltreated a sizable majority 43%. In contrast, male perpetrators were more common for children maltreated by non-biological parents or parents partners, 64% or 75%. Safest place you can possibly be in the home is with your husband and with your children. That that's for women. The safest place they can be. Any study that you pull up is going to be drawing from the NIS source. That's direct from the NIS itself. There's no refuting that. I've looked and looked and looked. It is definitely from partner incident violence. women are the safest when they have a husband in the home. I think for some women that is the case. I think there are good men out there and I think that's a misconception that feminists don't believe in and that there are good men that we hate all men which definitely isn't true. But I would like to say like because you're saying you know psychology is an evolving field. There are different studies and different numbers male perpetrators are predominant and while the exact percentage differs it's generally estimated that between 75 and 90% of child sexual abuse is committed by men or male adolescence. Nope. That's because it's not drawing from the correct data set, which would be the NIS. But the and the reason they do have the authority to say which one is the correct data set because they all draw from the NIS. All of them draw from this data set, the NIS. They have to. It's the most comprehensive source for reporting. So here's what happens. If you wanted to gather data, you're a psychologist. Are you seriously explaining to me how it works to gather data? No, I'm asking you a question. If you wanted to gather data, right? If you want, especially on crimes, you would use law enforcement or the best source for reporting, right? In this case, self-reporting is going to be far less reliable than reports to the police, things like this, right? Yes, understandable. So, you're saying that this is the most comprehensive, therefore the most reliable source. It's the most comprehensive source. Where are you finding that it is the most comprehensive? Because you haven't mentioned a source that says it is because I'm looking at it now. The NIS. That's not from the NIS. There's the National It's from the NIS. From the NIS. There's the National Center of for Victims of Crime in RAIN, which is the statistics that I just draws from the NIS. Okay. So then how come it draws from the same source? My conclusion is different than yours. Because they changed the criteria for what is considered assault and they change the criteria? Like I've seen it as bad as them saying that men cannot be essayed by women because it's non-penetrative. I see. So you're saying that those that would skew the numbers. It does skew the numbers. So the results of the national incident study NIS the largest collection of all types of reported data related to abuse the malreatment 68% of maltreated uh children were maltreated by a female 48% maltreated by a male. Women when they're in positions of power over the over people who are weaker than them actually abuse more than men do. So at the same time while you say well women have to run this big gambit of threats from men because men are much stronger than women and more have more propensity of violence when women are in charge of people who are inferior in strength to them they're incidences of violence towards them are much higher than men's incidences of violence towards them. It sounds like women are the greater threat here than men. Sure. Um if you want to say that that's totally your prerogative but that's not what the numbers say. So you can say what no no no it's my turn to speak. You can say what you want about all the different statistics and how they come from a specific study, but the point is that they are there are different estimates and basically every study conducted globally has found that the number of female victims is astronomically higher than male victims. Not to say male victims aren't important. If you are a male victim, especially if you haven't spoken up, I have seen the effects of having male sexual assault in my family. So, please like talk to somebody. It is serious. But one in six boys have been sexually assaulted. And a lot of the time it is by male offenders. But what about the fact that when we're talking about wages of abuse of children, women are are the ones who are most often in charge of children. The domestic rates for instance inside of a boy's home where the guards prison guards are all male and it's a male uh you know youth population versus female. If there's a female you uh females in charge of the youth population, the statistics for abuse skyrocket. Same thing inside of public schools. Are you saying that women are more likely to be uh women are more likely? No, women are more likely than men when it comes to the weaker sex. In this case, children, we would just say children are the the uh I not I mean both sexes, right? But they're they're the weaker human than women. When they're in charge of children, they actually abuse them far more than what men abuse women at. And so it's like, so who's really the dangerous ones here? Your 60 seconds begins. Go ahead. You're good. Thank you. Um well I would like to say that that is a a claim that that is a reasonable conclusion that you are drawing from the data that you are presenting. Unfortunately that that is not true though that the vast majorities of sex offenders are male and especially when you know there are still female offenders and that is still bad. But um the point is that there is significant male dominance and that most sex offenders are male and females do commit sex crimes but they're often under represented as perpetrators. So you're correct. Um but the data you're reporting is it do you want to continue? Yes, please. Um and so you're 60. This is from the United States Commission sentencing which is just about sexual abuse offenders. Um and there's a whole pie chart here but in like about how many times they offend and who they offend and um who they're under guidance for and again it is saying that the vast majority up to 80% of the perpetrators um are men. Yeah. Yeah. You can talk now. So women do you agree with me that well I have to ask some questions here. so I can figure some things out. I hope that you'll answer them. So, do you agree with me that uh both men and women have the propensity to in some way essay the other the other partner both of them? Yeah, I wouldn't say that it's I mean no yes I agree it is definitely possible for both sexes to do that. The question becomes if you have if you switch criteria around right for what is considered sexual assault. Let's just assume things like cat calling are put in the category that's harassment. But are you saying it's categorized not as harassment but as a form of sexual abuse? Would you say that that would greatly skew the numbers if that were how it was classified? Yes. Do you have evidence that is how it is? I do. In fact, there's there's a whole grouping of colleges in a study that I can show you where that was smuggled in as a form of uh of sexual assault or essay or sexual battery in some cases, right? They smuggle in but and so what they do is they decide that they want to make that data set wider and so they just reclassify things which would not ordinarily be classified as sexual assault or sexual battery by just inserting those things. Now the same same exact thing happens here. Do you think that it's very masculine, for instance, inside of society for men to go and report when a woman gives them unwanted touching? No. And I I matter of fact, I do know male victims with female perpetations. And they have unwanted touching. Yes. So, they're just far more likely to report it because of the social stigma, which happens to them often from women who tell them things like, "I don't consider you a real man." Like you did to me earlier. Oh. Um I didn't really say that, but you did. Your exact words were, "A real man would X." Oh, yeah. like real men like my dad who have the same political beliefs but don't talk to women the way you do. Yeah. Whatever that means. But anyway, so a real man a real man does X, right? Wouldn't you say that the social stigma around the fact that women can kind of get away with the same type of inappropriate touching without men reporting would greatly skew these numbers? Yes. However, I think that women um and men who are victims and are perpetrators as well, I think those are both under reportported. I think across the board it's under reportported, but more for male victims with female perpetrators. How many more for male victims? I don't know. But it could be it could be drastic, right? And I would hope not. And if it is drastic, then it would skew your numbers on all of those percentages across the board. Absolutely. It would. But the problem is we have no way of gathering that data. And with the data we do have though, I see what you're saying about the stigma. But it is so vastly that women are victims and men are the perpetrators that I don't see that catching up in any percentage. Why not? It it depends on how underreported it is. In fact, a lot of these data sets draw from unreported incidences via estimates, don't they? unreported incidences via estimates. Yes. So I suppose yeah there's no way that they can actually gather that data. Um yeah. Yeah. So this would be the exact same thing, right? They're making a supposition based on an estimate. This would equally have to apply to men. But if the social stigma is there by your own admission that men are basically not reporting the instances of unwanted touching from women due to this social stigma, we don't actually know how bad that social stigma really is, do we? No. And I mean that's also what feminists that's a great point and I agree with you because feminists that is one of Oh, it's also my 60 seconds, right? Well, we're having a back and forth now. So, okay. Well, can I have 60 seconds cuz I would just like to talk a little bit about like we can't like we can't get into a back and forth and then and then like arbitrarily demand whole blocks. Well, I'm just going to give some statistics cuz I think we're on the same page here. I think we've actually found common ground. So, the the stigma around um essay and abuse is what allows these numbers to be under reportported. And so I think that because that's what feminists want is we want men to be comfortable coming forward as well because we want safety and equality for the sexes. That is what the definition of the term is is the belief in social, economic and political equality of the sex. Let me refute these lies because well I think that some people don't believe that. All all national campaigns that I've seen hyperfocus on women and the abuse of women already making this supposition that men are the monsters and the criminals who are doing the unwanted touching and the essaying and because of that because this is done at a national level at a state level at a local level and the organizations and NOS's are all hyperfocusing on women. This stigma towards men is never addressed because women are only looking at it through the prism of women. You know it's not just women who are working on these studies right and who are writing these articles. It doesn't matter. Don't you say men can be feminists? Yeah. Okay. So, by your criteria, these men who have the same exact worldview as you, they're still hyperfocusing on feminism. And the idea always starts with the supposition that men are the more violent sex, that there are more often doing these types of of essay, sexual assaults, things like this. And what do we end up with? We end up with very skewed numbers based on the criteria, right? where uh within just a matter of minutes we can determine that not only can most of this stuff be replicated but we can also determine that just based on the viewed categorization of these things they can't be true these numbers can't be true okay no um so I don't understand where you're coming from with how it can't be true how something can't be true because again if you're going off of something being under reportported and the data not being there you're saying okay well then this is true which means this can't be true which means this and you're not even going from like actual data you want me to demonstrate it no no I'm okay I'm talking for now please um I'll demonstrate it real quick. So, it would be like this. You know what? I'm I'm actually okay. I feel like you've dominated the conversation for the last few minutes. If that's okay, if I would like to Well, I thought you just wanted me to demonstrate for you something. No, no, I'm actually okay on that. Thank you. You don't you don't want me to? You asked me a question. You don't want me to answer it. No, no, no. I was actually in the middle of talking. Okay, go ahead. Um, thank you. Um, so you're welcome. Thank you. No, like that was genuine. I wasn't trying to be I know. You're welcome. Thanks. Uh, yeah. So, um, the patriarchy is benevolent. Yes. So I think that the four principles that uh is it's a common misconception and if you want to refute these like I would love that but working to increase equality economically and politically for for women um which again not rooted in female supremacy but some people think it is uh expanding human choice human choice meaning male female everyone um elim eliminating gender stratification which means you know globally it's hang can we move back to two yes expanding human choice um and for everybody and And then three, eliminating gender stratification. Um, you know how like most of the power and money is concentrated to men globally. So sort of making the opportunities there for women. And again, like you have to think about this globally as well. Like not it's not we're very US- ccentric I think in this debate, but there are definitely countries where women are really really uh deprived of any sort of autonomy. And then the final one is ending sexual violence, which we've talked about quite a lot. So those are the four principles of feminism as we see it today. Um and although there are different places around the world I guess we can focus um you know sort of here and globally if you have points on that or if you just want to confine it to the US then let me know. Yeah. Well the US is where I live that's where I'm talking about. But okay so when we're discussing this this idea especially of no no these numbers are accurate that actually can't be true. You said no it it actually can't be. Well, no, it can't be because one, you've already admitted that there's a stigma towards reporting, which means that these numbers are already skewed right from the get-go. Here's a good demonstration of this. This is something you'll hear psychologists say a lot, and I'm sure you probably said it yourself, that mental illness probably has always been somewhat near as high as it is right now. It's just that it went under reportported, right? That's something that you would say. Or trans there's just as many transgender people now as there were or homosexuals. It's just that we didn't have the right numbers cuz they weren't able to report them correctly, right? So it follows then that if it is the case that under all of these circumstances due to a lack of reporting due to stigma we didn't have the correct numbers and so you can suppose that into the data that you have right now for how many there's always been why couldn't I do the exact same thing with SA numbers? No, you can. But um how are you going to get the fig like how are you going to get the figure that it is more are you saying it's more female perpetrators like than male perpetrator? How could you possibly get that number? Because if I look at the raw data and we look at stigmas, right? If we're looking we agree on stigma but the data how do you have because the data is not taking into account the stigma towards male reporting. But it is but I'm saying there are no reporting cases. Yeah. How do you how do you report the cases if the stigma is there for them to not report? So yes, given that how do we come up with any because you know these other places they come up with estimates studies that you just cited. So how do we come up with an estimate for female whether we come up with the estimate or not we have good reason to doubt the the uh the various estimates by RAIN and these other sexual advocacy organizations especially when I look at the NIS because when I look at the NIS I get totally different numbers and it's way more comprehensive. It's the largest most comprehensive data set on planet earth is the NIS and that's what it shows. It shows that women are far more likely to abuse their children than men. When when women are in positions of dominant power and authority over weaker people than themselves, they're more likely to abuse almost every time. This is also included in healthc care stats when they are in charge of people who are weaker than them in healthcare situations. They abuse far more than men do. You keep talking about the NIS like which specific like are you talking about the national in because what the specific study that you're talking about how women are perpetrators more frequently genuinely cannot find it anywhere on the internet. Okay, I'll pull up the exact study if you give me just a second. Yeah, no, that's fine. Um because I'm looking at like the Bureau of Justice statistics and like you know like the FBI from the US even the CDC find this from the US Department of Justice sexual victimization and juvenile facilities reported by youth 2012. Okay. Okay. And is this where you're saying that these are all comprehensive? These are all comprehensively included inside of the NIS. This is why I'm saying is that I have each individual study ready for you. The you can look also and we can we can move to this as well if you want to. Wait, so is this the one where you're saying that female perpetrators are more frequent? Is that what you're talking about? Yes. Yes. From the that's from the national incident study. Oh, national incident study. Yes. Okay. The largest collection of all types reported data related to abuse, malreatment of children. 68% of the maltreated children were maltreated by a female. 48% maltreated by a male. In every circumstance, the NIS finds that when women are put in charge of uh people who are weaker than themselves are more likely to abuse than the stronger sex, that being men. And what's interesting about this is it gives us every reason to believe that if women had the exact same frame and build as men did, that men that uh that they would actually abuse far more often than men do them. Right? So what we're looking at here is we're looking at a huge problem where women who are supposedly being abused by men are doing a whole lot of abuse which is going unreported of children while you're focusing on the scapegoat of men. Yeah. I don't doubt that women are unfortunately a lot of women are abusing children. But the study that you're saying the only thing that I'm able to find is that one in every 25 children in the US experience malreatment. Neglect is more prevalent than abuse. And then they talk about how for the 4% of children that experience genuine maltreatment and and danger of of death. But I I'm not seeing anything. Um it says, "Oh, girls were sexually abused much more often than boys under the harm standard and endangerment standard with male perpetrators being more common." That's all I was able to find. Um uh Okay. Would you like for me to actually link it to you? That was just from the juvenile facility study though, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But what about the NIS data? The NIS data is going to be the most important because it's the most comprehensive collection of it. It's funny because you keep repeating this talking point about a study that I can't find. Uh, well, how do you I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but from the So, you think that um the National Incident Study is not reporting this? Like, I could link I can link it to you. No, I I believe it. I'm just saying like there are so many more common sources that have different numbers talking about how male perpetrators are more common than the study that you're talking about because I genuinely I'll I got a little more for you. The US Department to me is that Yeah. The US Department of Health and Human Services has been tracking the data on child abuse and neglect since 1978 with something called the National Incident Study, NIS. The National Incident Study is a congressionallymandated periodic effort of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. There have been four such reports, the latest being the NIS-4, which came out 2010. This includes the breakdown. The NIS gathers data from all reporting agencies that and any study will pull from these agencies because it's the congressional authority which is gathering that data. The methodology the NIS uses the standard definitional framework for classifying child maltreatment including both types of abuse and neglect. These are the legitimate numbers and feminists have been hiding them under a rock because they don't want to talk about this issue. Um I I I think that that is an interesting theory. I think that a lot of the things that you're talking about go more into theory than into fact. And that's okay. I think that goes into what I'm saying is like just generally that's why I'm here is to debunk a lot of the myths. Um why you didn't debunk that myth? Well, again, you said you would send me the study. Cannot find the study that women are more likely to be perpetrators. It doesn't I I genuinely cannot find a single thing. I've been looking for 5 10 minutes. You've been looking for what? Have you been looking on? I've literally looked at exactly what you said. Cannot find the numbers. Because I like I'm not This is not trying to be like an appeal to like authority, but I've done like debate my whole life and like obviously like most of the time we tend to focus on the facts. So to me, if I can't understand the facts, I they don't exist of where I'm finding it. That is a problem for me. Okay. I I saw that it didn't say the numbers that you were talking about. Yes, it has them. This is from There's no way you scroll down so I can read it. How in the world? I was just on that website and they did not say that female perpetrators are more common. Did you read that entire thing in 2 minutes? That is nonsense. It is huge. There is no possible way you went through those numbers. I read like that is the biggest book. That is the biggest c. There is no possible way you went through that in 2 minutes. It is massive. Okay, you can think that. It's okay. What do you mean think that that is not humanly possible? Do you have magic powers that I'mware unaware of? I don't know. You're pretty smart. What? Oh, come on. At least be honest in the debate. I mean, there's you could just say I didn't read it. You I couldn't find the numbers that you're citing. There's no possible way that exist. The numbers that you're talking about there. They don't exist. Female perpetrators are not more common than male perpetrators. So like again I would prefer that we would stick to actual reality and facts that these are the actual realities and facts I just showed you the study right the most likely reason why women are more likely to abuse than men other than the fact they're not being used to checked on uh using force is the UK's leading mental health charity the mental health foundation says that today women are three times more likely than men to experience common mental health problems as well. Do you want to go over that about how men are more likely to experience mental health issues? No, females, women are more likely to experience mental health issues. What is your point? Yes. Than men. What's your point? Well, how is feminism combating this? I would hope that we can continue to do a better job. I mean, there's a lot of people that I know that really struggle with their mental health and a lot of I mean, we don't have to get too deep into it, but I know that a lot of women who have experienced some uh abuse uh sexually at the hands of a man and then that led them to have mental health issues. I also know men more than sold PTSD. No, no, no, no. PTSD is certainly an issue, but you can get PTSD from a number of things. So I I would like to point out that like just saying one thing doesn't negate the other, right? So like just because I think it's important to talk about women's mental health doesn't mean men's mental health isn't important because again they are more likely to like you know what about the fact that women's women's mental health has been astronomically growing in the negative direction under feminism especially under the egalitarianism of gender. They report they report the h the happiest levels that women report are when they're married and in traditional gender roles. Have you ever heard of the term ignorant? The phrase ignorance is bliss. I'm sorry. Do I want to I'm sorry. Do I need to go and experience killing someone? Right. To know that I don't want to experience killing someone. What? Well, ignorance is bliss. It's possible, for instance, that I could kill someone and really love it, right? To maybe talk about Well, hang on. I want you to answer my question. Is that possible? I just don't really understand how. Can you answer my question, though? If is it possible that I could kill somebody and then just really like it? But how does that answer my question? Please stop negating the question. Just answer the question. I just don't really want to talk about murder. I don't care what you want to talk. I want you to answer my question and I'll answer yours. I'm not answering your question. Just go to your You're not going to answer my question about murder that's not related to business. Yes. It's a Listen, it's logically answer how you think I would answer. Answer how you answer. What do you mean? I'm in a debate with you. I'm not in a debate with me. I'm not Why would I answer this hypothetical question about murder that has nothing to do with I was talking about If it has nothing to do with it, I'm going to look really stupid, right? So, just answer the question. So, um, go ahead and finish because I would like So, my question to you was, isn't it possible that I could kill someone who really like it? That would be yes or no. I understand how this works, but I need you to answer my questions. We're in a debate. I will answer your questions, but you also need to answer mine or I can't get to the worldview. Yes or no? Okay. I just This seems like a really moot point to me, and it Can you just answer it then? You've wasted like like two minutes not answering the question. It's like a three-hour debate. Yeah. Why are you wasting time? Just answer the question. Look, Kylie, it's it's conceivable that you're going to propose hypothetical questions to Andrew to test and I'll answer them logic and worldview. He'll answer it. He's I think it's a fair question. If you can answer it as the moderator, sure. Um I suppose it is possible. Yes. That if you did it, then you would enjoy it. Although it makes me uncomfortable to talk about that. Okay. But if that's if this is the Well, it would be possible for any human being. Yeah. Yeah. logically possible. So the thing is is that knowing that this is true that we could I am actually ignorant having never killed anybody, right? And I am in bliss about that. I myself am really really happy that I've never done that even though I could do that and be very happy about that. The idea that you would make the point ignorance is bliss seems to in I just want to give you I'll give you the the quick answer. I have to wait for you to let me talk. Thank you. You're welcome. So what I would say is this. When you say ignorance is bliss, all you're doing is alluding to the fact that people should engage in I'm giving you 15 seconds. If you don't give me Mike, I'm leaving. Go ahead. 15. Oh my god. You're going to leave? Oh no. Uhoh. Look, Andrew's finishing his point. I was He was finishing his point. No, I'm serious. 10 15 seconds because he's been talking for the last 5 minutes. So, it's really not fair. You're You're not moderating very well here. Well, to be fair, you guys got to allow We were actually doing really well, I think. Hold on. Hold on. until I was until I was making a broader point. Then then I that wasn't well it was at the expense of me speaking is the problem. Hold on just one moment. So look in in conversations and especially in a debate. Look, sometimes people are going to are going to butt in. There's been a few times you've done it, Andrew's done it. You've both done it. I'm trying my best here. Well, that's why I'm alerting you. I feel like at this point I would like to be able to speak my point because he he inter he rebuted me before I was able to give my point and that's that's been happening the last time. You asked me a question. Have you heard the term ignorance is bliss? So I could speak and explain my point. Yeah. So then I said yes and said but we here's the problem. Talk for about 3 4 minutes and then try to back me into corner. The expression when I ask you a question you answer it I expect a yes or no and then you give a comprehensive answer like I was. So can I can I give my my explanation? Did you are you done Andrew? Okay. Okay. So um you you going back like 5 minutes basically to what we mentioned was the term like oh women are happier in the home with a husband and kids right and so the term of ignorance is bliss I think for a lot of women who do not have the opportunity to get an education and they are forced to be in the home they don't know any other alternative so some women are truly happy but if that becomes the standard that women have to be in the home and have kids and they don't have the opportunity to get an education then of course that's going to be something that they think brings them joy because they don't have any other opportunities and so like there's a lot of people in my mom's generation or my grandma's generation where like they were like, "Man, I wish I could have gone to school and like had an education and like picked someone and they just fell into a marriage that either was abusive or like they weren't happy." And so I think that um it's easier to report higher levels of happiness when you perceive it to be your own your only option is living in the home and having children and raising them. So, but what do you have to say to that? Yeah. So interestingly because it goes to your like underreported things like well first of all when when you give anecdotal evidence like oh my mom and mom's friends I can give you an actual study if you want may have and I can refute it I promise. But here's the thing when you give anecdotal evidence and you say well my mom's friends this and that wish that they could have gone to school. There's also anecdotal evidence and an awful lot of it and you can find it on YouTube right now of tons of women saying they wish that they had not gone and gotten a career and wish that they would have instead deferred those childbearing years in order to have a family because they see the happiness levels of their friends, colleagues, f you know co-workers, things like this that anecdotally is also just as true. But to even go on to the ignorance is bliss. I could say this and make this case about literally anything. I could say, well, I would love heroin, right? I've never taken it. But ignorance is bliss, right? Oh, I could say ignorance is bliss about literally anything. Any drug, hang on. Any risky I didn't cut you off. Any risky behavior, any of this. I could say that about anything. What you're doing is saying I'm these women are happy. There must be some bad reason for that. Some women are happy. No, you're saying these women are happy and there must be a bad reason for that. And the bad because they're doing traditional Hang on. Because they're doing traditional gender roles. So that must be bad. So we can explain that away by saying if they had all these negative experiences that those women who have those negative experiences actually report a higher unhappiness level, those women would actually be happier. That's absurd logic by the way. Okay. Sure. Um well again I agreed with you on quite a few things there. But I would also like to say that like I said at the beginning in my opening statement, the home being the most dangerous place for women like there are women who are in abusive marriages and so they have to convince themselves that they are happy because their husband is beating them or like assaulting them or harming their children. And um when you're in that sort of situation, it's very difficult to be able to walk away from it and often times because you're isolated. Um and so yeah, because the home is the most dangerous place for women and you know six women are killed every hour in the home um around the world. Those are very difficult realities that a lot of people don't want to grasp. And I'm not saying that every woman doesn't, you know, isn't happy in the home. I think there are plenty of happy moms. I mean, my mom has worked and raised our children, you know, her children and my sisters and I and like helped my dad out with like work. But yeah, for the most part was a stay at home mom and I think she really enjoyed it. But for me at this point in my life, that's not something that I would like. And it's not to say that it's, you know, it's a bad thing, but I just I think that some people are um convincing themselves that they're happy when in reality it's a very uh difficult situation. Well, I'm going to have to go back to the NIS where I point out to you that as you keep saying that the most dangerous situation for women is in the home. Well, that's according to the UN around the world though, not just here. Okay. But inside of the United States at least and inside of the Western nations, this is a commonality that they all share. It's not usually from the husband. It's usually from boyfriends of single women or single moms or uh as far as for instance cohabitation. Cohabitation leads to some of the worst outcomes for women when they're not married and men. It leads to terrible outcomes for both. This idea that you have that some when you when you say this, it's very loaded. It gives the impression that husbands are at home abusing their wives. And the opposite is actually true. The truth is is that when women get divorced and they end up in these occupied relationships, that's when they end up with the most amount of abuse, not from their husbands. Well, I think it's uh you know how we were talking about earlier about like confounding factors and other things that might uh the classification of things might change the results of studies for this one. Um I'm looking about it looking at it and it says facts and statistics on you know domestic violence DV and it's mainly um including partner intimate partner. So it's it's not talking about husband or boyfriend. That's why we separate them right. So, we would separate those two categories to see who's the more abusive. Do you have a statistic? Yes, I just gave it to you twice from the NIS. I know, but like I I'm looking at it and again like I'm having Show me the numbers from the NIS that you're looking at. I actually don't believe you. Oh, I'm not looking at the NIS right now. I was looking at it earlier. Could not find the number you were talking about. Yeah, but you looked at it from one minute. No, I didn't. You did those I I literally pulled it direct from the NIS itself. When there is a minor in the home and there is abuse, they look at both parents and in that case they are finding according to this the domestic violence center data for mankind initiative. I'm finding the mankind initiative the cult the cult the mankind initiative. I I have no idea what you're I mean this is like a it's a statistic like it's like um a study that's produced or I could go to the University of Pennsylvania do that because the Mankind Initiative as far as I know is a western cult which exists as a deasculating agency just so you know um I okay uh well so it's saying analyzing 31,000 this is pen today um so this does uh go to your to your point it is just slightly above the spouse rate for abusive boyfriends. Um but again um and those go reported much more right than or I'm sorry the marriage rates go reported much more than the inter than these rates where you're living outside of the home with another man. Right. So because that's the more common living arrangement. Therefore I am correct. It is true that the most dangerous situations coccupancy not marriage. I mean there's different I think it's difficult. you you deal a lot in absolutes and as a teacher that's something that we are told not to do to facilitate like open communication is because you typically say well this is true this is true that means I am truth I am correct in saying this thing but again statistics are changing all the time so actually you're contradicting yourself because at the beginning you were like what I'm saying is I can negate I can negate these with logic by simply pointing pointing this out I mean you can negate anything when you talk to yourself like you do because you're not really listening to the words that are coming out of my mouth I'm listening to do you want me to steal me in your position you just said to me that everything everything when it comes to statistics is fluid. I would tend to agree with that based on data which is coming in. However, we still have to apply logic and inductive reasoning even when we're dealing with data sets especially. I didn't say we don't I agree. So those are unchanging unconfounding variables logic and reason. So, if we're using those two things, we can easily point to this and say we know for sure that it's going to be under reportported in cohabitation and possibly uh reported at least better from the marriage standpoint. That's probably that's probably true. I don't think anybody would really dispute that. Yeah, actually I found a study to your point. Researchers have consistently found higher rates of violence in cohabitating compared to marital relationships. But in those cases, still it is 95% of perpetrators are male. So, what do you have to say in terms of that? Yeah. Okay. So here's what happens. What feminism has done, especially with the destruction of the marriage, is it has put women in the most vulnerable position where now they leave their home with their husband where they're the abuse rates are not nearly so high as pretentious feminists pretend they are so that they can cohabitate with men, with other men who are strangers to them, strangers to their children. It puts their children at risk and it puts them at actually higher risk than if they had stayed with their husbands in most cases. Oh, okay. that makes sense as an explanation, but I think that um like again that's an anecdote that's probably not true for everybody. Um and the the cases are are pretty clearly in place like the the evidence has shown that regardless of whether there's children in the marriage, 95% of the perpetrators are men. And you know, we were talking about how it is likely under reportported for female perpetrators, right, in marriages. I'm sure there are abusive wives, but I think that the point being is that it is very um it is definitely a pattern in terms of in the United States of the home being made unsafe because of uh men that live there. It doesn't have to be the husband, but it is uh men that are um you know being violent with the women that they are living with. And I think your point about how it's it's women that are picking these boyfriends that are abusing them is not uh fair because again, you don't know men that are going to be to turn out to be abusive until they hit you one day. It doesn't start out with, you know, if you went on a first date with a woman and she clocked you in the face, would you continue to date her? No, you wouldn't. It's the same with women. Here's what we're going to do. Andrew Andrew, you give your response, then we're going to do a prompt change. Okay. Okay. So, I don't I Okay. But yeah, that was the end of my I don't even understand this. Like, all of the stats back up exactly what I'm saying. you agree with me that what I'm saying is likely the most true case scenario at least compared to all the numbers boyfriends being more abusive. Yeah. Can can I finish? Right. I didn't cut you off. So the thing is is like look as we look at this data the data backs up everything that I just said especially when it comes to cohabitation. You say well it's not women's responsibility that they're picking these men. It's like well women are initiating most of these divorces. For one they're leaving their husbands. They put themselves in this confounding situation where now they're being abused by strange men often because they want them as sexual partners or other things like this. You say, "Well, that's the true that the abuse happens inside of these places male whether there's children or not." Great. But when it's a cohabitation event where children are involved, you're now putting your children at risk because the the risk skyrockets for abuse. Skyrockets for abuse of those children. No wonder men don't want to get married to modern women if they're going to get divorced and their women are going to put their children in an abusive situation, right? And that's what the stats show more than anything. Not that women are being abused, but that when they have authority over children, they are putting them in situations where they are abused or abusing them themselves. That's what's actually happening. We do have to change prompts. Uh Andrew, I think uh you wanted to perhaps discuss patriarchy and force doctrine. You'd like to get into that? Go ahead. Yeah, you can start. Yeah. So, I'll give you my definition of patriarchy first. It's a historic definition. It's means rule of the father. I often will shortphrase this to from the father. Usually, it operates around something which is patrineal lineage rather than matrinal lineage, though not always. You can have patriarchies where there's matrinal lineage. You can find this in Judaism and other places like this. When I talk about patriarchy and broadly speaking, at least in modernity and in the last hundred years, about men being in charge of general systems, we could just say men being in charge of general systems, head of the household, head of the family, things like this. My view is that patriarchy is always going to end up being the default. Especially the more feminism there is, you'll push more people into the patriarchy role. And here's why. Because of force doctrine. Force doctrine is a doctrine which I came up with which tries to describe a phenomenon which you yourself are going to have to concede is true that half of the world right now if men decide to they can basically exterminate every single woman inside of their nations and there's not a damn thing women can do about it. We can find this in most of the Middle Eastern nations. We can find this basically anywhere that we look. Right? They can't actually do anything about it. Also when it comes to rights, rights are a social construction product of the mind because of that they are not inherent. And since this is the case, force is what is the practical applicator. And if men decided to by force take away women's rights, women cannot do anything about it, the opposite is not true. If women wanted to take away men's rights uh and men didn't want to let them, they could not. And because of this force doctrine application, women's rights all come from men, not inherently from themselves. Therefore, feminism is a lie. Complete lie. That's force doctrine. I don't know if you had anything to say about it. Um well, aside from the fact that that is genuinely a terrifying idea, um I think that the idea that men could just take away our rights and wipe us away is the nec is why feminism is necessary is because um we are trying to get enough men I suppose on our side if you think about it in terms of like a military occupation so that we that wouldn't happen. Um because I think that it is possible for men to take away our rights at a blanket pace. But I don't agree with your conclusion based off that premise though. I don't believe that women inherently don't have rights that it's given to us by men. And the reason why is because I believe that all human beings inherently should have equality and human dignity which is a although I'm not Catholic. It's a term that was very much focused on in my Catholic high school. I went to public school and then Catholic about humanity. Yeah. It's just a matter. Yeah. I mean it's still like important though to me because I think that because the societies that we have created have necess necessitated the the need or have created the need for um laws and for structure and government. And so there are many philosophers that have talked about how important it is to have government, right? But because of the fact that men can take it away does not mean that men g thus give to us, right? Like men are not gods. It is it is something that is inherent to each of us that we should have the ability to live and self-govern and have autonomy and um I think the fact that men could take it away actually goes to my point about how a lot of them do and a lot of them try to take our autonomy and um make us feel unsafe and harm us um which you were previously refuting but actually seems like you agree with me on that that it's a possibility for men to do that. No no it's well it's descriptively true. I'm not giving an aught. I'm giving a descriptive of descriptive reality. But because it's a descriptive reality, we have the truth is is that you appealed to patriarchy. I have no idea what I I have not said appeal to patriarchy. What are you talking about? When you said the whole goal is to get more men on our side. You're appealing to a patriarch. The whole goal, but is a goal. Yes, I should correct myself. And so what you're trying to do is you're trying to appeal to the very demographic which can take away your rights at any time, conceding that if you do not have them on your side, you cannot maintain your rights. That is not ever true of men, which is why you'll always end up with a default patriarchy. The more especially the more feminist push. I don't know if you're looking at the modern world. Oh, it's the modern world cuz not necessarily a default. It's always going to be a default. But in a lot of tribes, they were very matriarchal and like women were at the head of the family. There's never been a matriarch in the world. That is not true at all. Give me one. Okay, I will look it up. It's going to be an Indian tribe and I'll refute it. Watch. Well, indigenous people largely have. It's going to be an Indian tribe and I'm going to refute it. I think you should just use the term ind. I think you should just use the term Indian. I don't see any problem with it at all. Oh, I think they do. I don't think so. Indians themselves call themselves Indians often. Indigenous people in the United States do not call themselves Indians. Yes, they do. Just like black people call themselves black people, not African-American. What are you talking about? Um, do you think that all black people call themselves African-American? This is a moot point, so I'm not going to even go into this with you. Well, you're the one who wanted to tell police and say that I had to say Native American instead of Indian. Um, so basically, I'm pulling up the matriarchs for you. Um, and there are obviously a number of societies that have thrived and there's a whole document, but in China, um, in Costa Rica, the Briber people, yeah, name one. Any of them that you think is a matriarchy. Okay. Um, a matriarchal society. They have a society with an estimated 12,000 to 35,000 members. That is a matriarchy. And that is B R I B R I Bri in Costa Rica. Or you could look at the um there's a Kenyan tribe that's u M OJ A. um that are all matriarchies. They have women at the helm that are leading their why the Bribery tribe societies often describes matrineal, it's not actually a matriarchy. Women are the heads of households responsible for passing down culture and land. But the men have the most important role as the authority officers of the tribe. They are the ones who defend and ult they have chiefs too. Male chief, that's not a matriarchy. Well, this I found a different article. We could just go back and forth all day. Yeah, let's look at it. Um, so the brib. So this is the intercontinental cryb bre. I don't know if you speak Spanish, but bribun matriarch mo. So I speak a little bit, not like I'm not like fully fluent, but anyways. And they're talking about how um the clan structure means that tribal lineage is passed down through the mother and matrineally. Yes. And also in the home I know the difference. But if something is matrinal doesn't make it a matriarchy. I know. But they're saying that women in this article play a primary role in in government as well in Yeah. Not. But see what you did there? You did a smuggle. They play a primary role in government. That doesn't make it a matriarchy. But it's a system. You know what a matriarchy is though? It's a It would be women broadly in charge of all of the It's a system of social structure where they hold a lot of power. They hold the majority power and the decisions of the men are at their behest in any but that's what the article just said of the Bree tribe. I I don't know. I don't know. Again, I just found a different article. Any should speak to like what's going on. matriarchy that I've ever investigated which is supposedly a matriarchy we find very quickly that men are in the prominent positions of authority on force which means that any matriarchy is living at the behest of the men that's it so is your point that men are better then because they have brute force or like what's your point that men should be in charge governmentally my point is not I'm not giving an aught we have to agree first to a descriptor the descriptive truth is that it is in fact the case that women have to appeal to men for all of their rights period by your own admission. That's why you're trying to get them on your side because if you don't have them, they can basically cage women up if they wanted to and there's nothing women. But that doesn't mean that men are there for better or should be in charge. Like I'm confused. Like what's the actual point? Like the conclusion that you're making here? The point here is that men being in charge is obviously and clearly they're very benevolent because at any time they so choose, they can lock all women up. There's nothing they can do about it. And the reverse is not true, which is so interesting. You're literally at the mercy. Women are at the mercy globally and always have been of men. And yet we're monstrized and demonized by feminists. That's what we're we're literally considered demons by feminists. You did it by your own admission today with your own stats trying to make us out to be sexually assaulting monsters. Didn't even know the counter stats. Didn't say that. Never. Yeah, that's what it appears to be though from the onlookers perspective. I feel like you have these generic like talking points that you try to apply to feminists, but I haven't like really been very reactive or calling you names. I'm trying not to. I have. But you you have acted exactly like a feminist today, madame. Okay. But um nobody's going to be confused about that at all. The whole the whole snobbery the whole snobbery towards authority. You're going to do what I want. The finger clap thing. You did the whole feminist trope. The entire thing. But what I would like is a reputation here. Can you agree? I feel like it's my time. Can you agree that it is the case that women have to appeal to men for their rights and not the other way around? I will not I will not ever agree to the fact that we should appeal to men for our rights. I think that is an inherently misogynistic question. Have to have to. No, do not. Okay. Well, then where do rights come from? They should be inherent to every person. But again, I think I should be able to like this. You make your So, give me a second because again, like you've just been a little bit insulting the last few minutes. So, I feel like when that happens, it's just like a good change of pace is important. Um, but well, I I I do need to keep it on the topic at hand, but which again, where were we? Can you repeat the question? Rights. I asked you where rights come from. Where rights come from. If you can address that. Okay. But then I get to respond. Yeah. Yeah, you can. But it's on force doctrine and rights. Go ahead. Okay. Um, well, I think the fact that we're debating a topic that you came up with is a little bit strange personally, but um I was going to say that I think that rights are inherent. Um, I think that they should be related to all people. Just like the fact that we are human beings, we shouldn't have to appeal to any person for authority. And again, the fact that men are stronger, bigger, more powerful doesn't mean that they give or take away people's rights. I'm not religious necessarily, but I think if I if I was, I would probably tell you that I think God is the person that, you know, relates and who is who gives people their human dignity and rights, but I think it's inherent. I think that we should all have the right to live and be free of violence. And I think that those who offend and try to put people in cages, those are the people that should be um jailed. Like, I don't think that that's a a blanket statement. Yeah. Yeah. So I would just Okay, you keep on saying rights should be inherent. That doesn't tell me anything about where rights come from. Where do rights come from? Where do we describe rights? Well, I think that you're thinking very like United States like governmententric. Anywhere. You can pick anywhere on planet. I don't care where you pick. Where are rights coming from? They are coming from the set of people that are in charge, the government. And to your point, that's the patriarchy. However, I agree. So I I concede to that point. However, I'm saying that that is not that does not mean that men since they create the ability to give people um like rights and take it away, that doesn't mean that men it should be that way. It shouldn't. It like I don't know if that makes sense. So men have been guaranteeing your rights the entire time you've been alive. No, that's definitely not true. Well, I don't understand. I thought that you just said rights come from the government. The government is the patriarchy. The patriarchy then is giving you rights, right? Right. But like the government isn't inherently like the government is influenced by patriarchy, but it's not like all men making decisions like in the past it was. Would you say it's mostly in charge by men? Yeah. But again, like I think that your um your points that you're making are very uh misogynistic. Like I think the point of what you're saying listen is like we should be grateful to I think the points you're making are very misand that it doesn't tell us. But I don't hate men so that's not a very good Okay. But your question inherently is rooted in the fact that you think that there is male superiority and that men are in charge. Descriptively, men are stronger than women. Yeah. Descriptively. Yes. There's You're not going to argue that point, right? On average, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. On average. Well, I mean, it's a strong average, though. Sure. Yeah. Like I mean, you know, teenage soccer teams are beating, you know, female pro player teams, right? You agree that that's the case? Okay, great. So if that's the case and we can agree and you agree that the governments of the world are patriarchal then you have to concede that the patriarchy is giving you your rights right now. I again I will never concede that. And the reason why is because I think that that is rooted in the idea that women should be grateful. Like you're telling me that I should essentially be grateful to you for the fact that I'm not in a cage right now and that someone's not assaulting me as we speak. Like that does not mean that about just your like your right to free speech and the fact that it's enforced by men. the patriarchy is the ones giving you that by your own admission. Listen, so my theory is the way it should be. This is what I think. This is the way that it was before we had col, you know, colonization and all the imperialism and stuff. There's a blanket statement, right? Or there's a blanket right to to life, to um autonomy, to all these things, right? That are just given to you by the nature of being human. And there are certain entities and people and oppressive regimes that then come in and they try to take those things away from you because waring tribe theory. Well, because they they give you those things or because the government gives you the right to exist now, right, doesn't mean it's a benevolent uh patri like doesn't mean the patriarchy is benevolent because it is currently giving me these rights and I'm not like sitting and trapped in my house like I am. What would make it malevolent? What would make it malevolent? Um I think in places like um talking about here in the United States, which is a patriarchy by your own admission giving you rights, what would make it malevolent? Um I think that there are a lot of current things that are malevolent um like in legislation and things like that that are you know like right attacks on bodily autonomy and like the overturning like the DOS decision or the but you would consider your first amendment a benevolent right your third amendment your your fifth amendment I think these are things are all inherent gener like I don't like just because it's written in by the government doesn't mean that it should inherently be it can't be that's a contradiction you can't say it's inherent and the government gives them to us that's a contradiction the government does but it it doesn't mean anything like we should already have these things like just like if I how do you have them? How do you have them absent government? You should just be able to walk around and be free and how do you have that without force? How how is it even possible? I think you're looking at it through a lens of like imperialism and I don't think that like force was always ne it hasn't always been necessary. I'm looking at it through a lens of I literally told you my lens of force doctrine explained it described it has nothing to do with imperialism has to do with this. You're walking around there's no government. If you're walking around there's no government, where do your rights come from then? Okay, this is just like such a silly question. Please answer the question. Okay, so if I if there's no government and I'm walking around, my right to be alive, my right to uh find a can someone come around and kill my can someone come around and kill you? Yes. But in that case, there have historically always been place ways of punishing people who take those away. So the people who take them away are Hold on. Just let her finish a government. Go ahead. Hold on then. Go ahead. The people who take those things away from you, if they don't decide to take it away, it doesn't mean that they're good. Right? So like a really horrible example that for a lot of women is true is if I am a woman and I have not had intercourse with anybody and a man is my friend and he decides that he's not going to take my virginity from me. Um does that mean he is a good person inherently by not assaulting me? No it doesn't because that should be the standard. Right? And so if someone comes in and they take it away and then they they tell me that they can or they can't in the future. Right? That's essentially to me what you're saying is just because the government is is giving me the right to walk around and have this conversation with you today means that I should be thankful and I should, you know, not be concerned with things and that you guys are actually benevolent. The patriarchy is benevolent because I'm not in a cage because I'm not being assaulted. Yeah, that's not what it's being said. Anyway, can you answer my question though? Where if there's no government, where do your rights come from? Um, I think we've already been over this. I think you've asked me quite a few answer. Listen, what you did was I mean I've already told you human dignity. So well human human dignity account you can't account for dignity in a secular worldview. What is dignity? It's just whatever you think dignity is. So tell me this real quick. You have rights they're inherent. I'm talking about legal moral or human. Let's let's omit legal, right? Because I I'm talking about in a hypothetical. Okay. Moral and human rights in for me it's rooted in the philosophical natural law. Natural law is Catholic. You don't believe in Catholicism. You would have to have God to back up natural law. Okay. But that is what I developed my beliefs around because I used to believe in that. No, that's a if you don't appeal to God for your natural rights, you're making a naturalist fallacy. Okay. How do you know that I don't believe in God? Because you told me. Okay. Well, I just again I think this is like a really ridiculous Why is it ridiculous? So, where do you get your rights from if they're not from God? Um, okay. So again, I still subscribe to the human rights theory, which is uh the un universal declaration of human rights if you're if we're not going to go talk about God or naturalism, right? Which is that every human being has universal inalienable rights that are fundamental to each person. And so this is what you know the UN subscribes to and stuff like that regardless of whether there is a government in place or not. So is that sufficient to you? No, that's an axiom. That's so all you're just saying is I think we have inherent rights because I think we have inherent rights. I think we have inherent rights because we are human beings who deserve to be treated with compassion, love, and respect. And I don't think you think that. So yeah, but that's pretty wild. But the qu the question comes in here. Let's say that a group of people doesn't believe in these inherent human rights, right? They don't believe in them. I mean, there are definitely groups that have Yeah. They just don't believe in these inherent for certain people. Yeah. They just don't. So what is it that protects those inherent rights for you? Well, you're right. There is a typically like a system in place of force. It's not force per se. All force, right? Anything that's not like there's a way to like isolate those people um with what? Force. I mean, not necessarily. Not what else could you isolate them with if they don't want to be isolated? Well, not not every arrest is made through force, right? Like they might Yeah. Well, actually, all all arrests are made through the implicit implicit threat of force. Either you come with me or else, right? Sure. So, that would be force, right? You would agree with that? The implicit? Yeah. I mean, just this inherent topic to me is very just like violent and seems like a moot point like um but I mean I'm kind of I I feel like we've talked this through. No, I haven't talked it through yet. But you you can continue. I mean, I don't really have much else to say. I've already like critique of your worldview so that we can understand who you're appealing to for these so-called rights you believe everybody has. In this case, it sounds like you're banking on force from men to protect your rights. I mean, how are you not how are you not banking on the force of men to protect your rights if you say they're inherent, but all these inherent rights require force? Well, also men is a is a generalization. I mean, again, there are a lot of people who are currently working to enforce the system of government that we have. It's not just men, but they all rely on male force, don't they? I just told you that wasn't true. I mean, okay. Can you tell me how that's not true? Like, what what agency of government doesn't rely on male force? No, no, no. My point is it's not all exclusively men. There are men and women and everyone else as well that work to protect people here like like in the army it's not like if you're using force, right? The army isn't just male troops. So like you're saying male Yeah. There's there's there's women who aren't allowed in combat for the most part almost ever unless it's by accident who are in the military as pay masters and things like this, but they're not the executors of force. There's not female armies being fielded to protect rights. I just I'm not super interested in this line of questioning because it it just seems like misogynist. If you're interested in it, I want to know the worldview. I think you care because like it's your podcast and like I'm kind of Okay. Well, you know what? In your next argument, I'll just say, "Well, I'm just not very interested." Okay. What does that do? Well, you're not really letting me talk or like, you know, I'm just asking you basic questions. You refuse to answer them. That's it. I just wish you would actually answer the questions and then we could get somewhere, but you just refused to. I'm like, "Okay, so what does that mean?" And you're like, "Well, I just explained it." when he didn't actually explain anything and then we get to the root of it. So what you keep doing is appealing to patriarchy for your rights by saying I would never say I appeal to patriarchy for my rights. You say hey I want to I want to appeal to men because we need men in order to protect us from the patriarchy which means you're appealing to men for your rights. I just like it seems like it's a big circle. So I'm just trying to decipher it out. That's it. That's it. Okay. Not not going to not going to engage anymore. All right. I I already told you I just don't have anything else to say on this. So I I feel like we've had a good conversation. I mean I I've enjoyed hearing what you have to say, but I just don't have Yeah. I mean, I would have enjoyed, you know, like actually critiquing the view, but since you don't make the view, you have for like the last like 15 minutes. Yeah. No, you've just been very evasive and you've been very unwilling to actually answer questions. Even when you've contradicted yourself, we want to acknowledge it. So, okay. Well, we can take a little uh there's more prompts, but we'll uh take some audience questions. There's some super chats that we can get to. So, we have uh let's see, we have just Gerald here with the $100 super uh donated $100. When women say, "I wish I would have gone to school or focused on a career instead." I hear my children are preventing me from freedom. If only these kids weren't alive, I could be happy. All right, just Gerald. Thank you for that. Appreciate it. All right. And if you guys are enjoying the stream, be sure to like the video, please. And uh make sure to uh Oh, if you're watching on Twitch, go to twitch.tv whatever. Drop us a follow and a prime sub. And oh, that's weird. Uh did that not go through? Okay, going to get the soup chats here. We have Cole Marshall. Why would anyone This is from earlier. This came in. I saw this. That's funny. Uh why would anyone care if you leave? Who are you? You're supposed to be defending your worldview. W Andrew from Cole. Thank you, Cole, for the super chat. Do you want to respond to this or Oh, sure. Yeah. Um, yeah, my name is Kylie Brewer. I'm sort of like an upand cominging like activist type person. Um, I I feel like I have my goal here was to educate um just about feminism generally. So, um I'm sorry if that hasn't like held up to your standards. Um but yeah, I if I do leave, I think the debate would end. So, I think that might be why people would care. But anyways, thank you for your comment. We have chaotic fuzz. Why are you letting her hold the debate hostage? She's being a child saying if I don't get my way I'll leave. It's disrespectful to the platform and listeners. Um I think uh it's disrespectful to be talked down to the way I am. Um so that is why it's not just about like leaving and holding the platform hostage. It is rather a fact of protecting my um integrity and I will never let myself be in a place where I feel unsafe or um like I'm being belittled. So if that does happen and continues to happen, I will leave and it's not a a reflection of you know the platform or anything. It's just like for me um as well. So okay, we have Lucas here. Ma'am, kindly address your emotional dysregulation. It's unimpressive, but more importantly, a telltale sign of an intellectual mediocrity flailing away. Wow, a lot of big big words here, Lucas. uh in the undertoe of cognitive dissonance, facious logic, and ultimately a fully metastasized mind virus. Do you want do you want to respond to that from Lucas? Sure. Um Lucas, it sounds like you pulled out your thesaurus for this. So, congratulations on that. But I would like to say I have my IQ is relatively pretty high. I'm not going to like talk about where I went to an Ivy League, but that doesn't matter if you disagree with me. You're going to hate what I have to say regardless of whether I'm intelligent or not intelligent. So, but thank you for watching regardless. Thank you, Lucas, for the message. Little Miss Feminist isn't interested in debating, only educating bad faith debate. You want to respond to that? Thank you uh Reszle for the soup chat. Um for me, like a debate is about exchange of knowledge. So if it doesn't become that, it feels more like um an ad homonym attack on me, I just will not talk. Well, what it what a debate is to me is the reputation of ideas. Uh or it can be the sharing of knowledge, also the reputation of ideas. We're here to debate feminism. the idea of debating feminism that I'll even grant one point that my opponent got which was me dunking on me right was that I confused the mankind initiative with the mankind project right so that's one thing one thing I even did right dunked on myself right by misspeaking on on one of these things so there's a concession but here's what I won't do what I won't do is let you cross your arms and throw a fit and refuse to engage when you go no I'm just not going to engage anymore it's like Well, then we're not having a debate anymore. So, I'd like to get back to the actual debate and I'd like to continue. I like don't have as much of a stake in this as you do. So, like I'm definitely if we end right now, I'm more than happy. Like, I'm so serious. I would go and like lay out in the sun, enjoy the farmers market. I'm here to You're just not So, so why did you come to a debate if you're unprepared to debate? Oh, because no, I'm not unprepared. I thought we were going to have more of an exchange and this feels more like again like an attack. So, that's why I'm not having very much fun. I mean, look, I don't think that's a fair characterization of the exchange you guys had. There was a slightly open to interpretation. There was a slightly heated moment exchange from both of you at the beginning of the show. I think it's okay. We're going to continue on with the conversation. Let allow me to let uh we have about three chats coming through and then we'll get back to the debate. Rachel Wilson says, "This is, by the way, this is uh Andrew's uh wife here." Oh. Uh nobody's talking down to you, princess. Uh oh. She wants to do Colin. Uh, do you want to talk to to Andrew's wife? Maybe she can get some. I don't know, but okay. Uh, Andrew is just beating your arguments easily and you feel embarrassed, so you're pretending he's insulting you. Okay. Thank you, Rachel, for that. Appreciate it. Donner, page 199, section 6.3 of the NIS-4 shows all the stats Andrew pointed out about female perpetrators. Anyone in chat can look it up. All right, thank you for that. Even though she said she looked it up in two seconds, even though there's no possible way. on. Uh, somebody says unmute. Okay, thank you Andrew. I'm not sure what's going on with that, but we have two chat two chats coming here and then we'll come back to the debate. So, we have one sec. We have Glockavius. Thank you, Gloavius. Glavius donated $100. Kylie, you said you have a high IQ. What's your IQ? Um, I haven't taken an IQ test in a while, but when I was a child, they had me evaluated for having a high IQ because I was like talking really young and all these things, but the last time I took a test, I think it was like around a 150, but I don't know currently. It was a while ago. 150. Yeah, that's genius level. And I know you're going to say I'm not, so it's like funny, but I know it's you probably think it's ironic. I didn't say anything. I just said that that's considered genius level. Thank you. He was about to congratulate you. Oh, sorry. I'm on the defense a little bit, but thank you. I appreciate it, Andrew. I appreciate it. Poor me. I just have an an average IQ. Okay, we literally have average IQ. And you know what? Look here. Here's a little, you know, a lot of the soup chats been a little mean. YOLO Swagons says you're hot. Thank you. So, if it's any uh, you know, if it's any, you know, thank you YOLO Swagons for that. That does actually make me feel nice. Thank you, YOLO Swagons. And then chat here, then we'll get back to the debate. Sixpack Chad donated oneack Chad. I didn't go to school for 4 years to be talked to like this. The girl boss can't handle the big meanie. Andrew, you are the most insufferable broad I've ever seen on this show, including the hookers. We have had a couple hookers. Yeah. Um, I've actually had that uh said to me quite a few times. So, I'm sorry you feel that way, but I'm glad you like Andrew and like you guys have that sort of connection. I think it's important to have people that you look up to and content and stuff. And uh so getting back to the debate at hand, Andrew, did you want to continue on with the force doctrine conversation? I but like I need you to actually engage with my inquiry. The the reason I'm giving you maybe Oh, I thought we were going to switch topics. Oh, we're staying on this one. So, the I think he wanted to just finish. Yeah, we weren't done with it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, the reason I want you to engage with it is because it's a falsifier for your worldview. Okay. And if you refuse to engage, it looks like you're just refusing to allow the falsifier for your worldview. So, can can we get if we can get back to it, I'd like to. My question starts with inherent rights. You claim that they're inherent and I'm asking you if a government's not giving them to you and God's not giving them to you, where are they coming from? That's a good question. So, if we just existed, there was no government and I was an atheist, I would in theory have the uh ability, the right to walk around freely, to make myself food, to do all these things without the fear of uh violence. But if violence did happen um then we would have to create how would you in theory be because I believe that communities to just walk around without any threat of violence because there were plenty of communities that have done that in Does a rabbit have the ability to walk around without any threat of violence inherently? No, but I'm I'm not a rabbit. Yeah, I know. But the thing is is like why not why doesn't the rabbit have that? Because there are predators. So what would our predator be? Are you saying men are the predators? Well, or women or But if men are the predators, that goes against everything we talked about. Or women. Did you hear that part? Or women, like women can assault you. Doesn't require a man, doesn't require a penis for somebody to assault you. So the thing is is like if it is the case then that that the rabbit has no inherent rights because there's predators or people who would be predatory or even if we said that there would be some men who would be predatory even. Mhm. How do you have this right to walk around unmolested and the rabbit does not? Um, so you are wanting me to say that we have force. We have to enforce it, right? Which we do. But I don't think we have to enforce it through like physical force. I think we can enforce it through like words and like being able to like speak to each other and then like the rabbit screams and the coyote doesn't care. So if it's a case that people don't care about whatever the wolves don't care about what the rabbit says, right? They don't care about the rabbit screams. Does the rabbit have rights? Um, if the wolf doesn't care if the rabbit screams, does the rabbit have rights? Is an interesting question. I suppose the rabbit has the right to not get eaten by the wolf. But like again, I mean, I think most people would agree that there is a fundamental distinction between humans and animal societies. So, I don't understand how it's relevant to my point. In this case, the equation would just be a rabbit is a biological walking being, right? And so is a wolf. The rabbit does not have the right not to get eaten by the wolf. What gives you any inherent right to not be in any way assaulted, molested, undignified, or whatever? If if it is the case that people want to do this to you, what is the inherent right there? Right. I could I could ask you the same thing. Yeah. But why don't you answer the question then ask yours? No, no, no. I'm I'm saying like like I could ask like figuratively I could ask you the same thing in terms of like what would give you the right to walk around and to like be respected and have your wife Rachel like you know like talk to you and force but I don't I don't think it has to be. I think historically a lot of it has been force but I don't think it has to be. I think there exists an egalitarian society where we can all collectively have the ability and you know we they used to just I don't even disagree with this. Can can this happen? Well, they used to just um like sort of expel people out of the community and they wouldn't be able to survive without the community. Like they would die. And so that's not necessarily in my mind force. Yeah. It's force. They can't go back to the community. So people are forcing them out, right? But it's not like a physical force. It's physical force. It's backed up by physical force. Why can't you go back into the community? What happens? Well, there's also the emotional component of like ignoring the person, not giving them food. It's not That's not what people did. They didn't ignore them. They said, "If you come back here, there's going to be consequences, right? Otherwise, that's not really a banishment. I mean, what would stop them from just walking in and being like, "You can ignore me, but I'm going to take your food and whatever I need to survive." Sure. Um, but the point being for me, I believe that because those types of societies are possible to exist, right, without the physical threat of force and having to put people in cages and kill people to preserve the social order. Then therefore I think that we should not have to um have a patriarchy or a matriarchy. I think we should just be able to exist in the right because the right come within us. I I agree that you can have all sorts of different arrangements for how a society because of those things then. Yeah. But that doesn't give us the answer here for why it is that the rabbit doesn't have the right to not get eaten by the but you have the right to not get assaulted by another human being. What gives you that right? I mean, I don't think I'm going to at any point give you the answer that you're looking for. I'm just looking for the answer. What you said is because future societies can look different. That doesn't tell me anything. That's really not like what I was saying. I was also drawing from the past, but um I I mean, personally, I think that Sorry, the problem here is that we have seen um we have seen the patriarchy as something that should be either seen as malevolent or benevolent. And I don't think that it should be classified as something that we need generally speaking. I think there are systems of organization where we don't have to rely upon men. Can I try this because that seems to be what you're trying to Let me try a different way. Can you repeat my question to me so I know that you understand what my question is? No, no, no. I I would just I mean again, can you repeat my question to me so I know you understand what it is? Please. I'm getting real close. I'm Why? Because you won't answer this question, right? I am answering in a way that you don't find satisfactory. I'll say, "What do you want to eat tonight?" And you go, "Margarine hat." It's like it doesn't tell me nothing. But you're asking me the question repetitively because you won't answer it. No. No. No. I won't answer it in the way that you want. No, you just won't answer it. Period. Listen. Do you think Do you think it's a fair answer for you to say, "How tall are you?" And I say, "83." Is that an answer? Well, I don't I don't need an answer from like I'm not demanding. I'm not someone who you're looking at me like I have to answer you. Like just because I'm here doesn't mean I have to do anything. What are you doing in a debate if you won't answer questions about your worldview? I mean, there's a lot of reasons to be here, right? Like answering questions about your worldview, your brand. Do you think you're promoting your brand? Well, when you won't answer questions about your worldview, I mean, that's objective. And I have been answering questions. You haven't you what you've done is every single time I ask you this question, right? You appeal to something that doesn't answer it. You say, "Well, there could be future according to you." Okay, I'll tell you what. But I've given you the answers I have. That's why you're trying to force me into a corner that I just I don't have the answer. Let's try this. Let's try this instead. Right. Because when people people do this all the time. They say, "I am answering the question." When they're not answering any question at all. Can we just try this? Can can you just give me a re like real quick summary? Where do rights come from? Okay. So, I think that and I'm you're going to say, "But you don't believe in God." So, but I'm going to give you because this seems to be the only naturalist or the only explanation you will accept for from me is the naturalist explanation. I think that they are inherent. And let's say human beings are God, right? Some people believe that each person has an essence that belongs to God. So let's say that. So therefore it's it comes from God. We are God. I believe that each person is made up of a collective that could be considered like a human spirit. So yes. So but you don't believe in God. But a human spirit to me is God. So I think that each person has the ability to self-govern and those rights are given to us by ourselves because whether we're God or not. Okay. The rights come from us. Okay. Yes. So and and that's coming from the humanist perspective. So rights come from you the individual. That makes Okay, that's at least an answer. So rights come from individuals. So how do individuals then if they grant themselves these rights keep them? Um by communication and compassion. I'm an optimist. So ideally we don't have to use force. And somebody does not uh want to agree with you and says I don't care what you say. What what what happens then? So, okay, I will I will concede your point that to preserve the order to preserve rights. Sure. You would have to appeal to force then there are occasional needs for force. Sure. Okay. Well, let me make this because I know that's what you're trying to Let me make this even wider. Let me make this even wider. I don't believe that you can name any any uh type of governmental system or any type of anything in which force is not going to be the backer for what the establishment is period. I don't even think it's possible like how could it even be possible that you're not always force. Let's say I concede then what's your point like relating back to my point is always yeah you're always going to be appealing to men for your rights. But why do men have to be the enforcers? Like let's say your forces like force do because women can't overpower men only men can. But weapons exist. So like what if women is better with weapons and who who makes weapons? Okay. But what if like women somehow took over all the weapons and going into this hypothetical? Right. Sure. Women take over all the weapons. We teach each other how to use it and men can't do anything in theory. Could then a matriarchy exist? So I could say that it would I'm genuinely curious. Yeah. Yeah. So, I could say it's logically possible, but just so you know, when I say logically possible, Superman's logically possible, Wolverine's logically possible, all the X-Men are logically possible. Though, I can say that this is logically possible that women could seize all the means of production, all weapons, and enslave men. Logically, there's no contradiction. The descriptor for reality though is that I would say descriptively in reality it's impossible that women could never overpower uh men collectively, take over any means of production nor begin to produce weapons ever and have any great effect if men didn't want them to. It's not even possible. I don't I don't see how it's possible. So your conclusion though is based off of this scenario that you are saying isn't possible, but you're saying it's it's logical. So I mean I I disagree. I think it is possible though. Like but try to understand the difference between logical possibility which just means no contradiction. Yes. So almost anything's logically possible. Yeah. Right. Um it just seems like like there's a world in which you're a man and a misogynistic man. That's logically possible, right? Yeah. So like so that doesn't tell us much, right? But but I'm saying like your force doctrine though, like you're saying, okay, so let's say I agree with the fact that force is necessary to keep a necessary precondition. Right. So let's say I agree. Yeah. But then your conclusion that you're male because of this men are the enforcers, right? Because they're physically bigger. Therefore, men give us our rights. Yeah. Well, no. I would give it I'll give it to you in this premise form. It would work like this. Yes. Women cannot collectively overpower men. Men can always collectively overpower women because the sexes need each other. Literally need each other. Cannot be disassociated. Otherwise, there's no humanity. Um it there'll always be a banking of an enforcement arm which protects women and men and children and that will always have to go to men because men are the physically dominant sex. So if that's the case, it will always be the case. You have to appeal to men for the very rights in which you you think you have, right? Um yeah. So, I mean, I think that what follows what based off of what you're saying makes sense, but I I'm still going to always disagree with the fact that women like your like your initial statement that women cannot uh overpower men with weapons. I just I think that that would be Can you name a time has ever happened in history? Collectively, doesn't mean it can't. Just because something hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't happen. Wolverine can't h Wolverine can happen. Superman can go on with this forever, right? But no, but not really. Because if we're talking about descriptive reality, do you honestly believe that you're only disagreeing with this cuz you just don't want to agree, right? Cuz you said, "I agree that what you're saying it makes sense." I just fundamentally don't think this is like a very u entire worldview because you'd have to say that you have to appeal to pages here of like rather talking about like I don't understand. This kicks the pillar of your worldview out. Do you believe that you need to appeal to men for you to be safe or not? Do I need to appeal to men to be safe or not? Yeah. Currently in the patriarchal society, yes. Do we should we have to? Do can is it possible for us to not have to? Yes. And do men protect you? Not always. Yeah. But mostly, unfortunately. No, not even mostly. Aren't they the ones who are aren't they? Yes. Mostly. I'm sorry. Are most women dying? Are most women dying from violence? No. So, they're mostly being protected. It depends on what you mean by like protect though from harm. Like there's just a lot that women are harmed by men on a day. Like you live in a nation in which you're granted massive amounts of rights. You're protected while you sleep. You can dial 911, have officers there almost immediately in most places, but you're attributing all that to men. They're the enforcement arm of all of those collectives. Yes. Right. So like police officers, you would agree vast majority male, right? and that women tend to uh to underperform in almost every standard because we lower standards for police officers so that women can be them even though they don't actually perform very well against their male compatriots, do they? Sure. So, if that's the case, then you're still appealing to men, aren't you? Sure. Okay. I just I don't really want Yeah, I know. I know you you'll just concede just to concede. I mean, fundamentally, I don't think this is very interesting. It's kind of funny, right? It's there's a reason this isn't taught in like a man's verbally assaulting you. You're just rolling over and taking it cuz you got it. You just roll it over. I would actually prefer to leave. You just went dead fish on me, right? You like a like a bear is attacking. You went dead fish because you just can't refute the arguments. It's not about that. It's just about not being disrespected. If I feel like I'm being I'm not disrespecting you by asking you questions about your worldview. No, no, no. you're just being um how do I say very uh demanding and overbearing because it's actually I know I know I'm like debate I need you to answer my question that I would rather talk about and we've been talking about your topic for 45 minutes and I've barely even had a opportunity to steer this conversation. Do you have a bunch of topics that you brought? I brought one. Why can't we talk about mine too? We are. Oh great. Then what's your complaint? You're hiding a little behind the mic. Can you try to You don't know now what your complaint is. Did you Did that argument not work very well? You brought 10 topics. I brought one. You don't want to talk about my one topic, but we should talk about your 10. Fantastic. Fine. We can move on. But unbelievable. We will do a couple chats here and then we'll get into our next topic then. Bring in the chats. I'm going to go out of smoke. All right. He sounds good. Maybe you should just Can you pause it or do should I stay here while he goes out? Can I take a break after him? Yeah, we can. We can do that. Uh, okay. So, we have Xerxes here or actually Xerxes donated $100 on these. Hi, Kylie. Are you a communist or anti- capitalist? Can women be sexist towards men? Can minorities be racist towards white people? Is misogyny worse than Missandre? That's a that is a great question. Yeah. Sorry. Can I answer it? Yeah. You know what? Why don't we do this just cuz maybe Andrew will want to weigh in on he'll probably have things to say. We'll wait. Okay, that's fine. Let's see if any of these here. I'll let this one come through because this one's kind of just general. Red Fox donated $100 humanism, naturalism, theism, and relativism. What a mess. Your world view in incoherent and destructive. Your pretentious presentation is a turnoff. Bring on Mrs. Wilson. Not one step back. Anything you want to respond to there? Um, no. I I just wasn't like prepared on this subject and it's an interesting topic. So, I will uh learn more. I mean, I'm always open to learning more, so I will go do my research. Got Jason. Thank you, Jason. Jason Castle donated $100. Thank you, man. People sleep peaceibly in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf. This quote sums up reality, but you refuse to concede because you don't like men, dumb. Yeah, I really um I do believe that men are important figures in our society and I admire a lot of the bravery of men. Um so if you want to call me stupid, whatever you want to call me, that's totally fine. But I never said that I hate men. I I do believe that men are important and I like men. I'm close with my dad. I have a partner who is a man right now. So yeah. All right. And if you guys want to get your own message in, you can do so. Streamlabs.com whatever. We're doing $100 TTS. We have Jordan Flores here. Hey, thank you, Jordan. Appreciate it. Jordan Flores donated $100. Thank you. Can someone tell her that the restaurant kids menu crossword puzzle isn't an IQ test? Also, ironically enough, when she mentions quitting every 15 minutes, it proves Andrew's point. Yeah, Jordan, I'm not I'm not like mentioning quitting. I'm genuinely trying to leave here because I do not enjoy this environment. It's very hostile. Um, and I know that the restaurant menu is not an IQ test. That's kind of a funny joke, though. But thank you. Okay, we have some super chats here. Honest question for the feminist. How's feminism in any way about equality when every single policy and law it advocates for is literally a move away from equality? Even Charles Forier, who coined the term feminism was a staunch massandrist. Drist, maybe a little typo there, but do you want to answer Manny's question here? Um, yeah. So I mean again that's an absolute not every policy is about a move away from equality. Feminism has never been about female supremacy. It has been about the importance of creating equality between the sexes and creating protections um from you know for for women in various areas economic political whatever it is. So um yeah I don't know if that answers your question but all right we have Andrew back here. Manny thank you for that soup chat. We have two from Lucas here and uh two more. It looks like some on Streamlabs. Lucas, thank you, man. Uh, honey, you don't want to go toe-to-toe on credentials and alphabet soup with me. I assure you the alphabet soup is far more expansive than the law degree that Brian and Andrew might possibly be aware of. That notwithstanding, as logician, rehetor rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric, and debater Andrew continued, is superior to me by order of magnitude. Rest assured that piece of paper signifying your full-fledged year, four full-fledged years of imbecillic indoctrination is mean meaningless. Oh, but hey, how many genders are there? Would love to hear your take on that. Do you want want to respond to uh him on that or Lucas on that? I bathroom break if you have anything to say because remember I was going to Yeah. Do you want to do a quick response to Lucas or Oh, okay. And then feel free to take um Yeah, that's an interesting um that's an interesting question. Um I think that for me, I believe that sex is biological. So, it's what's assigned at birth, you know, so it's like male, female, and then gender I think is really like open to interpretation. But like definitely, you know, man, woman, um trans man, transwoman, non-binary are the ones that I really like, you know, see pretty often. But, you know, there's room. I I mean, I just think it's very individual. So, but yeah, good question. Okay. Yeah, feel free to take your break. We'll uh read a couple chats here. All right, we've got one sec, guys. Uh we have one sec. Where is it? This one's for you, Andrew. Chat for you from from USMC. Useated $100. Andrew, if you had some cleavage, maybe you could garner some soft feelings, too. Also, M's dipstick is touching the right side of her nose when she wants to be fed an answer. Uh, USMC, thank you for your message here. We have Well, the thing thing is is like it's not like you can't look up a thousand different debates that I've done easily, right? And know that you're coming into a debate with somebody who definitely is going to press your worldview. I haven't even been mean. Like it's just like how how is it that these women are such girl bosses but at the same time they're so fragile they just break, you know? It's like you barely even touch the sur they just break. They just crumble. It's ridiculous. Yeah. Um you know what? One sec. I want to put it on I I need to put it on intro for just a sec, guys. No, it's okay. I'll do it. Sorry about that, guys. Folks, we're we're back. Just needed a little private word there with uh with Andrew. Uh let's see. I was I was officially chastised for no for the idea only for the idea that I wasn't reading enough of these super chats because you guys aren't sending enough of them in. So do that immediately. We're on a what we call on the crucible an obscene profit break. And with obscene orthodox looking beard comes obscene profit break. And don't tell me you haven't been entertained. Yes, guys. Are you not entertained? Yeah, the viewership has been uh gang busters. It's 13,500 concurrent just on my channel. On I don't know what you I think you have maybe 3 4,000 on yours. And then on Twitch on our end, we have Speaking of Twitch, uh we have how many on Twitch? Uh over over a thousand watching on Twitch. So, by the way, real quick uh message here. If you guys can go to twitch.tv/ whatever, drop us a follow and a prime sub if you have one. Um, Brian, do you mind real quick while we have such a large concurrent viewership? If I do, just a couple of shoutouts, I'd really appreciate it. Like to shout out uh some whatever guests who've come on recently. Jay Dyer would be one. Made by Jim Bob would be another, of course, Jake Rattlesnake. I highly suggest all of you guys check their channels out. They are fantastic. I'm doing a little bit of shilling and making Brian a bit uncomfortable, and I'm fine doing that. No, it's fine. Yeah, we've had them on recently. They have some good shows. All right, guys. Uh if you have been enjoying the stream, like the video, please. Also, you can always support us. Venmo, Cash App, whatever. Pod, they don't take a cut. Just uh Ashley, thank for the five. And I think that's it for the shout outs. Thank you for the five on Cash App. $100 TTSDreamlabs.com/ whatever. We do have a chat coming through here from let's see this one. Yeah, Xerxes donated $100. Hi, Kylie. Are you a communist or anti- capitalist? Can women be sexist towards men? Can minorities be racist towards white people? Is misogyny worse than misandry? So, there's like four there. Why don't we start with the first one? Um, how do you what's how do you categorize yourself? I guess um I'm reluctant to use any like label in terms of this, but I think that there are like definitely cons to capitalism, but there are a lot of pros like um you know like ingenuity and like invention and creativity. So, yeah. Um, but I think that there's always room for improvement in a system, but no, I would never describe myself as like a communist or anything like that. Okay. And then there was the uh can women be sexist towards men? Yeah. Uh, good question. I think that women can definitely like have like not like men and have like a lot of like maybe prejudice towards men. But I think like just the term sexism generally refers to like a systemic issue. So like you know how for decades and decades like women couldn't uh you know work in certain fields or they couldn't get a job, women couldn't open a bank account until 1974. That's like sexism because it's a systemic issue. So that's the way that I think of it. Obviously I'm sure he has different opinions on that. Um but yeah, men but you're not here to elevate women over men even though No, I would like for women to like be but they can't be sexist though only men because it's systemic. There was one more, right? Uh yes, but it seems like Andrew wants to engage you on that, but here uh yeah, we'll go how about we'll go through all I feel like we might go for a while on that one. Yeah. So we'll we'll we'll get back to it. But can minorities so I guess like black, Latino, whatever. Can minorities be racist towards white people? Um there's there yeah like there's definitely um an a level of like maybe strong dislike or like maybe like prejudice towards white people. But I would say the same thing about uh like serious like like racism is like systemic. Like there were laws to uphold it like you know Jim Crow laws and a bunch of other laws to uphold um you know even like the institution of slavery which is really you know for like hundreds of years. And so because of that, the the racism that is embedded into like our laws, whether on purpose or not on purpose in the United States is systemic. And so that makes racism primarily that way. Um, and yeah, so I don't think minorities can be racist to white people. I think it's prejudice, though. I think the terms are different. It's like, you know, you know what I mean? Like the hatred or the the fear exists about certain groups, but the term is the way I explained it. Okay. And then the final one was just uh is misogyny worse than misandry? Um yeah, I would say so. And the reason why is because misogyny is built into uh laws and policies as well versus misandry is just like a lot of the time is rooted in genuine fear. Doesn't make it, you know, okay, but I think like it's better to, you know, see people as they are. But um I think misogyny is again more of like a deeply systemic issue and a lot of violence, gender- based violence is rooted in misogyny um which cannot necessarily be said for the other way around. Obviously there's always exceptions to everything. Got it. And then so Andrew there was the can women be sexist towards men? Can minorities be racist? So I reject Yeah. So I categorically reject these definitions. These are what are called institutional definitions. what they are as their definitions in order to reinforce a worldview rather than actually give descriptions for what is reality. So if we're talking about race for instance, right, and racism, uh if you're talking about what are perceived racial groups, why couldn't minorities be racist towards the majority? Well, what they what academics do is they play this pretentious game where they're like, well, you have to have institutional power. Well, that's also Hold on. Uh, can you just I I hate to interrupt you, Andrew, uh, can you just can you repeat what you just said to me privately there? Yes. Um, I would I will be needing to leave at 6 p.m. So, for anyone who is leaving um or who was watching and not 6:30 because uh I have a lot of reasons and one is that I have to drive 2 hours tonight um in the dark. So, I would like to leave at 6 p.m. and I'm making that known and um I hope that our agreement can be fulfilled. Uh but can you specify I mean you agreed to do 6:30 I thought 6:30 that that was the agreed upon right yeah um I mean I don't again asking me to continue to explain myself is a little bit tiring but I just I there's a lot of reasons I mean I have some health issues I just sitting here for this prolonged period I was not told by the way that this was going to be 3 hours I thought it was going to be an hour max so I agreed we didn't we didn't specify that it was going to be an hour max So why would I actually was very poor communication on your end. But anyways, I'm telling you that I will be leaving communication on your end. You're going to a show and didn't bother asking how long it was going to be. No, I did when I got here, but I will be Wait, wait, wait, wait. When you got here? I'm I'm leaving at 600. Okay. So, we can have as much of a debate as we want. Yeah, we we understand. That's not satisfactory. I would like I will leave now. Like, I'm just letting you know like this is not an environment for me that I am uh Oh my god, you whine so much. You're such a whiner. You just whine and cry. Yeah. I'm I'm just letting you know. I don't But what was Okay. What was the other thing you said? We can't do a debate. He's going to ask me questions about my will be deal wasn't prepared for. I'm just here to teach and monologue and I don't want I don't want [ __ ] ridiculous. If the con like we I signed something about coming agreed she agreed to 6:30 right in front of me. I like and now she's retracting it. It's like what what is going on? I don't know. And mind you, uh Andrew has just already done two debates. He did one on Friday and and flew in also for my opponent and very kind to me. You're welcome. Those debates I also don't live here. I flew in. I'm in Chicago. So, right. Those those debate Wait, I'm a little confused. You flew in. I flew in. My have family that lives an hour away. So, I spent, you know, a little bit of time with them this morning and then I'm going to see them again before I fly out tomorrow. Well, okay. That we'll discuss that after the show. But um and the if you looked at our channels and the length of our previous debates, the past two debates that we had were gone 5 hours and yeah, I mean again I have health problems. Yeah, but why would you have a different are you [ __ ] serious? [ __ ] serious. Why would you have a different assumption? Why would But why how would we know that? I'm telling you now. Of course. But don't you think that if you saw the last two episodes, they went 5 hours. Why would you presume that yours was going to go less and that we would know you had health issues? Because I'm telling you, I have When you get to the show, oh my god. Wow. This is an initial this is a disclosure now. But look, so we're going to continue the conversation, but there was one other thing you said to me there in private. She's like, she's you're fundamentally a dishonest person. Like fundamentally dishonest. There's no reason for you to have hold that presumption at all. On top of the there being no reason for you to hold that presumption whatsoever. uh you get to the studio then say you have health issues. It's like yeah, you know, it seems fundamentally dishonest, right? I mean, that's just kind of something that you don't want to disclose cuz it's a little embarrassing, but we're not asking you. Are you going to cry? Look, strong woman. We're not asking you. I thought you were a strong woman. You guys have a really good day. I'm leaving. Hold on. We're not asking. Hold on. Hold on. We're not Look, I thought you were strong woman. Kylie, do you want to just take like three minutes to gather? No, I'm leaving. Like I'm driving home. Um I mean you look you agreed to I agreed to appear not stay for the entire Yeah, but that you can't do some technicality where Well, I showed up for 2 minutes and I'm just going to leave and get the benefits of Look, Kylie, just take a five minute breather. It's You still there, Kylie? Yeah, I'm here. Look, do you want to take a five minute breather? Come back and we'll we'll talk more. Okay. Um All right. Uh here I'll do some chats. I'll read some chats. Uh let's see here. We have Oh boy, there's a lot. Um and I and I think we were about to get into a really good segment there when it came to uh is misogyny worse than uh mis misandry? Uh can you be uh sexist towards men? Can or can women be sexist towards men? So let's do this. Uh, here we got Wait, Kylie, you I'm great. I'm happy. Okay. Okay, that's fine. All right, I just uh All right, so we have Red Fox here. Red Fox donated $100. Brian, great job as a mod. Andrew, I am sorry you have been putting in so much work and this is the quality of your opponent. Glad your family is safe. Not one step back. Look, bring on the blood sport. And for those of you I know there's probably a few of you in chat who are like, "How would he do that?" Well, here's the thing, right? It's like I've been engaging in good faith, engaging in a a typical debate. They're going to they're you know what I mean? And the whole time it's been all about tone and Andrew's bad and this and it's like, you know, and then we get to it. She lied to routine. She agreed to 6:30 before the cameras rolled. I'm telling you, she not only agreed to it, but uh basic I mean they discussed it and she was like, "Yeah, 6:30." Then she changes her mind, right? And then kind of was very dishonest about the reasoning behind it. And you know, there's a form of female manipulation which happens when they're like, I don't want to disclose any health issues because it could be embarrass. It's like, well, then why did you agree to the show? We didn't ask about the Yeah. No, but of course not. It's all fundamentally dishonest. And so it's like, you know, what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to look at her when they turn on the waterworks when, you know, it's clearly manipulation and be like, "Oh, okay then. Yeah, [ __ ] that. [ __ ] that." I've had two really good faith interlocators we've gone back and forth with. I don't hold any ill will towards them, but it's like, you came to do the debate. I flew out here to do the debate. Do the [ __ ] debate. Stop. You know what I do? Just do the debate. Yeah. Yeah. And uh and I think we've been uh probably very I don't know if charitable is the right word, but uh almost uh bent over backwards. Yeah. like you know uh super annoying really at the beginning she was trying to dictate terms and look to the audience I know you guys didn't like that I was trying to kind of plate things a little bit but in you know like I was telling Andrew just in furtherance of ensuring that the debate actually happens if you got to you know walk back an inch you know to to be able to make it further then so be it. But uh we let me do these super chats while they come through. Yo, Gerald, appreciate it. Coastal operator, thank for the membership. Uh, okay. JJ Mad, thank you for that message. Uh, let's see here. We have uh I'm honestly kind of lost on some of the chats here. Okay, all good. Yeah, I'm good. All right. Um, oh, whoops. Didn't mean to do that. Uh, so, okay, here's where we left off, right? Right. Uh, Xerxes was, uh, can women be sexist towards men? Can minorities be racist towards white people? Is misogyny worse than, uh, mis misandry? Excuse me. Uh, Andrew, it seemed like you wanted to uh, yeah, so it's just it's just academic double speak. It's just it's a way for them to hold uh, dualistic standards. So, um, what they mean by what they mean by racism is exactly what they mean by racism across the board. It's just that in order to make whatever they consider the oppressive class not be oppressed, they call it something else by saying there's not enough institutional power. But if you were to ask them something like, well, what about over in South Africa, right? They would still say that, nope, whites really have the institutional power there no matter what. No matter what. So, it's like um it's never and I've been in these debates multiple times. It's never a consistent definition. It's an academic double speak. Uh um when it comes to misogyny, worse than Missandry. Yeah, right. Um the only reason that she says that is because she believes in a bunch of stats which are completely false. They're totally false. We've been over them multiple times. Women do just as much damage with their m Missandry as whatever she considers misogyny to be. And the truth is it's all just de demonization. Yeah. I don't know why she's crying. I don't know. I have no idea. I'm not I'm not crying right now. But yeah. Okay. This seems very manipulative, by the way. I'm just pointing that out. But yeah, you're entitled to your beliefs. Mhm. Would you like to engage with uh uh the misogyny being worse than uh misandry? Um sure. Topic. Yeah. I mean, I I'll just read out the statistics that I have here um about violence against women, and that's basically what my, you know, my belief that misogyny is worse. Misogyny kills and misandria noise is sort of a phrase that people say. I think both definitely aren't healthy, but um one in three women experience violence in the home or just generally in their lifetime. World Health Organization, 50% of women are murdered in 2017 were killed by an intimate partner. United Nations um a lot of child brides um with victims being women married to older men as well as 71% of human trafficking victims being women. Um we often use for sexual exploitation purposes and that a lot of that is rooted in the belief that women are property and objects that men can do what they want with. Um and yeah, so that's why I believe that misogyny is worse. I think again though I will concede I think both can be harmful. And can I just point out real quick that uh sexual liberation is a key cornerstone of feminism including only fans things like this and that's been linked heavily to sexual trafficking. And still the left does everything they can to promote that women should be able to engage in prostitution even though it leads to those very same outcomes which is insane. On top of that she says misogyny kills misandry and noise. That's not true. We look at uh post- divorce stats for suicidality for instance. uh same thing even pre when it comes to men's health they do want to allow themselves higher rates right now I would still argue that that's mostly because they're better at it but also because and what I mean by that is that like women will basically not use they just won't use guns right and men use guns um but yeah I would say also when you we're talking about misogyny versus misandry what's really interesting about this is they'll often only point to the stat of death as though that is the only stat which is worth looking at you look at what's going on in society, we also have to look at children, the effects and outcomes of children. The demonization of men through misandry often will lead to men or uh uh boys, young girls, things like that, losing respect for men. It also leads to men losing custody of their children, which leads to bad outcomes for children. Like just be even if it were the case that I accepted all of her stats, it it by the way that also proves that feminism. It's not doing a good job protecting women. Literally failed its promise of protecting women. But on top of that, let's can we just point out that she doesn't bring up the outcomes for children ever. They never bring up the outcomes for children, which are completely and totally awful when we have these split family homes and the glorification of single motherhood, which feminism has done. They only point to the fact that well, misogyny can lead to the unalive. Also, can I just point out uh what about the fact that there's about you know a million women plus a year who murder men's children in the womb. I just want to point that out while she says well this is basically Miss Andrew's just harmful harmless annoyance at the same time remember having a million abortions a year. May I just ask were you I'm trying to Were you Were you listening? Okay. All right. Um, I was listening. Okay. Do you wanna Sure. Um, refute or counter. I think that like being pro-choice it like the way that it's it's defined about taking life is always going to be open to interpretation. I think people will think um, you know, different things about when life begins. And so ultimately the crux of that it seems do you it seems like you believe in God? Do you? Yeah. So um I think that because of that we will never see eye to eye because I don't consider it to be murder before a certain point. Like obviously like if the fetus is viable if you know like there are certain points where I only ever use secular arguments. So even if it is the case of believe in God. Yeah. I've only ever used secular arguments. So what would your argument be? um like that the case for sentience makes no sense and that scientifically the established scientific consensus the legitimate scientific consensus non- sociological consensus is that this is a human life at conception immediately that is the scientific consensus you can look at any source you want that's the scientific consensus so if that's the case right then we should treat it as though it's a human life sure yeah and I again I think that's going to vary from person to person um I think that there's a lot of people in the scientific community. And again, the scientific consensus does vary on when life begins. It does not because the religious uh idea is the consensus does not vary. There's no source you could ever look to, and I'm willing I'm willing to be corrected right now live. There is no source I've ever been able to find, right, which refuts that the scientific consensus is that human life begins at conception. Oh, thank you. There would be no other way to determine human life other than that it began at conception. You wouldn't even be able to determine it another way. But you can go ahead. What does scientific consensus say? When does human life begin? Um, sure. I'll wait. So, it's saying that there are three different perspectives. The scientific, philosophical, and religious. Scientific. Most biologists agree that a new unique human organization comes into existence at fertilization. So, a human life at at conception. at conception, right? But but they're saying that a new human organism, but there's people that have different agreements. That doesn't necessarily necessitate that. That that doesn't mean life. Well, what is life? It's alive. I mean, that's that's it's um that's what I'm saying is it's different for everyone. They're saying that the human organism forms at conception, but that doesn't mean it's life. Well, what is an organism? Is it alive? I mean, like they're talking about human life. Yeah. Okay. But what Yeah. What is life? It would an organism would be alive, right? I mean, but again, there's a difference between human life and an organism. Don't you agree? Isn't Well, if an organism is alive and it's a human organism, then it's human life, right? How could it not be? I mean, yeah, you can believe what you want. I think just different people are always going to have different opinions on it. And I I was just pointing out the scientific consensus. Yeah. And I was correct, right? Scientific consensus by most biologists, which would be consensus. Yes. Say that human life begins at conception. Right. Sure. Yeah. So then what we're left with from the secular perspective is sentience and that really makes no sense. That's it. So I would always use a secular argument. Secularists can't determine when sentience begins. Since they can't determine when sentience begins, there's no reason for us to assume it doesn't begin at conception of life. Okay. Yeah. I I mean there's different arguments for like So I think your argument is more biological. That makes sense. Um I understand your argument. I mean there's different reasons people argue for being pro-choice and pro-life. So, pro-life, pro-choice, but um you know, there's different ways of looking at it and I don't think we'll ever agree, so I don't know. Um but yeah, but good. I like I enjoy hearing about your arguments and what you have to say. So, I've never been, you know, yeah, I never heard that specific point. So, Kyla, you mentioned that there were some topics you would have uh other topics you would have liked to speak on. Is there uh from your prompts, would you like to bring any of those up or Yeah. Um I just would you so do you really believe that out of the four components of the four principles of general feminism which is working to increase gender equality that's number one and expanding human choice number two how do you suppose that those two things could be problematic? Yeah let's start with um expanding human choice actually. Okay that's one of my favorite ones. So you're not really for expanding human choice right? Like just only kind of I like you don't want me to have a choice to be able to drink and drive, right? Uh sure. Yeah. You don't want me to have a choice to stop at a stop sign. Like Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Like short of some like externalized emergency. So what choices do you want me to be able to have? Let's start with those. Sure. Um anything related to agency. Um like within reason without harming others. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean me drinking and driving doesn't harm others. Opportunity, right? Um does me drinking, driving actually harm others? It can. But everything I do can harm others, right? So that's that's a strange argument because when you're talking about freedom of choice and you say, well, we can limit this choice because it can do harm. That would be everything. So let me let me um clarify then. Okay. expanding human choice such that it promotes autonomy and agency without infringing upon the rights of others or the safety of others. Yeah. Now you see why I was so specific about rights because it's definitionally part of what you believe, right? Being specific is important. So yes, it's being specific is super important. I was very specific about rights. That's why I wanted to know where they came from because I looked at your definition which I wrote down earlier which was the four parts. And I'll read it to you. the parts if you don't believe that I wrote it down. No, I believe you. I believe you. You've definitely been paying attention. So, but you keep but you you kept on saying like I don't think that this is pertinent when we're talking about force doctrine and rights. But the entirety of your second pillar of feminism revolves around choice and rights. So you everybody should have a choice unless it expands to infringe on someone else's rights. Right. Like a living person. Yeah. Yeah. Like a living person. Okay. We'll just we're going to leave abortion and all that aside. We're just talking about we'll we'll just say like you're alive at least we'll agree you're alive at when you come out of the womb. Sure. Right. We can agree to that. So, but here's the problem, right? It's like let's take something easy like guns for instance, right? Um should I be able to own an AR-15? Depends on who you ask in which state. I'm asking you. Do I think you need an AR-15? That's not what I asked. Should I be able to own one? Should you be able to own an AR-15 that has Cuz there's specific types, right? There's like ways you can prevent the AR-15 from firing round. I mean, a fully automatic machine gun. Okay. Why are you taking away my choice? Um, because like that would be an example of the specification that I made about how it infringes upon the safety of others. Okay. What about a semi-automatic? Um, that's a good question. Um, I don't really know why anything that even that large and semi-automatic would be useful, but I don't know a lot about AR-15s. I understand. I'm not trying to hold any potential ignorance you have about the operation of guns against your argument. After all, I can say tractors do a lot of damage and not know anything about tractors, but still know they do damage, right? So, I think that that's a legitimate argument for you to say. I mean, I know. Yes. But yes. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm just Well, Dean, well, what is it chambered in then? I mean, my dad is like has a lot he has like a gun safe and he I grew up with him like shooting and stuff. So, do you know what what caliber an AR-15 shoots? No, I don't. Okay. So, I mean, again, I'm not familiar with AR-15s really, but Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so we would say like functionally, you don't know too much about the product we're talking about. I'm fine with that. I was just pointing that out to be hypercharitable. But how how is that considering the fact that I will never and almost nobody who ever owns an AR-15 will use one in a violent act? Why is it worth limiting our choice? Is that true? Oh yeah. Do you know for instance um almost all gun crime is committed with handguns and almost all of it is committed by one segment of the population with handguns. When it comes to long guns, that would be uh the black population mostly with handguns. With handguns and then with shotguns, is that what you're saying? No. No. With rifles or shotguns, you're more likely to be beaten to death with hands and feet than than a rifle or a shotgun. H including an AR-15. That's if we took all of the mass things. I can't say what they are, but the mass things that you know happen. If we took all even all of those into account, you're still more likely to get beaten to death with hands and feet. Interesting. Than you are to So, but how does that expand my choice then though that I that this is an operational thing that I want and somebody definitely wants to sell it to me and I want to buy it. Why are you limiting my choice? Yeah, I mean I think that's a good question. And I feel like it's very um philosophical at that point. Um I do think like the stigma around owning guns. Like I I'm definitely for stronger. I just don't understand why anyone would need to own like a fully like just the fact that if anyone got their hands on it, it just is scary. Um I don't know why anyone would need to be able to shoot that many rounds that quickly. Well, you believe in rights, right? Yes. The right to own guns I do believe is important. Yeah. So that would be a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Right. That's our second amendment, right? Yeah. No, I mean, and that is a right. Sure. And wouldn't it be infringing? I'm not trying to take it away. Like, yeah. Well, you're trying to limit my choice with that right. And you haven't explained how exactly it infringes on anybody that I own an AR-15. I mean, there have been Yeah. I mean, I think the most notable example, wasn't it? I mean, I I'll have to specifically check, but the one in I can grant any like mass, you know, homicide event that may have happened with an AR-15. Sure. What does it have to do with me? Um, right. I think the the point being I think is to determine if something infringes upon the rights of others or or the safety of others should be uh is something that is up for like debate. And so I'm not here to tell you like what does or doesn't what is or isn't like I'm not like a governing agency. You should probably ask somebody who knows more about that. But it's the second pillar the second pillar of your ideology, right? talking about human agency in terms of like not like the right like I'm specifically talking about the ability for someone to get the job they want. Like you you immediately brought it back to guns. I'm talking about the ability to have the equal opportunities to like have someone take care of your children while you go to work and stuff so that you can advance your career. Like I think that's fair. I think that's a fair a fair point to make. So if like a woman wants to get a job at a firm where a man controls the firm, doesn't want to hire because she's a woman, you would say that that's infringing on her choice. Sure. Yeah. Okay. I think that that's completely fair. If it is the case though, it's like I don't know enough about guns to be able to like accurately come up with something. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Well, we could use anything that you could ever know about gun gunwise and just use that instead of an AR. But the point is is that if I wanted to have a firearm of my choice, Yeah. Right. And it wouldn't actually hurt anybody. The expansive of choice seems like you're saying that that business owner doesn't have choice because she has the right. Right. However, if it harms him and his business, it's the same argument you're making for the AR-15. You're saying because other people may do bad thing with this, right? May may do, you know, like horrible things. Some people may the vast majority of people do not, right? We need to govern their choice in order to have safety for society or safety for individuals, right? How is it though that if you tell people who they have to hire, you're not also limiting choice? How how how does that work? It's not saying who you have to hire. It's saying who you cannot discriminate against. Like you know the 1964 Civil Rights Act. I think that racism is designed to combat or that legislation is designed to combat racism and sexism. Yeah. Versus like so the the protection is more for the person like there's more protecting being done for the person who is being hired than there is harm being done to the business by being told they can't be racist. So that's how it outweighs it. Can you demonstrate it? Sure. Um, so if I'm a woman and I'm equally qualified as a man and I go in to get a job and I, you know, they're telling me that I can't be hired because I'm a woman, then that causes immense psych psychological and financial harm, right? For the company to have to hire me instead of the man, even though I'm equally qualified, that does not actually harm them in any way because I have the same qualifications and abilities as the man does. Okay? I want to go buy a fully. Does that even harm the company? I don't know. Well, I think it does because well, because it limits the choices and demoralizes the agencies at the top who may not want to hire you for whatever arbitrary reason, but like let's say specifically it's like they don't think women are good in like at the job. Sure. Let's just say that that's true. You think that should be pro protected. Well, I mean, from their view, it's going to hurt them, right? Like there's no doubt that that's going to hurt them. You may not agree with the reasoning why it hurts them, but you can't it's going to hurt them. Subjectivity versus like you're saying for the subject it's all subjective there, right? No, but the subjective No, I mean not necess like the objective there is an objective truth that discrimination is harmful. Wait a second. You don't agree? Wait a second. Hang on a second. Then that would also be an objective truth then that if people are forced to do things they don't want to do like hire people they don't want to hire then I would make the same argument that you think that's as bad as racism. Did I say as bad or objectively harmful? Okay so let's so so when I say like I want to go buy an an AR-15 and you say no you can't. Right. That's doing the exact same thing. I don't understand like what's the distinction here? It sounds like you're telling me what I have to do. Yeah, I mean I think some people some people see it that way. I I do have an interest in public safety though. So um I think that sometimes um you know certain actions if they're racist, sexist, harmful, cause a lot of psychological or financial or other physical harm, I don't think that those should be protected over the beliefs of the inferiority of a person. Are you aware of that? Based off of a characteristic they can't control. Yeah. Are you aware of how many DEI laws there are? I mean, I know there's a roll back now that Trump is in office, but sure, go ahead and explain. Yeah, I mean, um, when it comes to hiring practices or non-discriminatory practices, right? There's hundreds and hundreds of laws of both the local, state, and municipal and at the federal level, right? Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds which govern this behavior. M you're telling me that none of those, which all of them are designed to expand choice, are infringements upon the hiring practices of people want to hire who they want. Like if I wanted to have a male only firm because I just wanted one, why is that actually a problem, right? I mean, I guess to your point, there are like women onlyly gyms, you know, and yeah, if I want a male only firm, and literally I'm public about it. I'm like, I just don't want to hire women cuz I don't really like them that much. If I just said that like outright, I just don't really like them that much and I just don't want to work with them and it's my company. I [ __ ] own it. I built it. I invented everything. What is actually the problem with that? Why can't I just do that? Um, why do you want to Why do you want to like infringe on my choices? Like the 1964 like Civil Rights Act is probably going to be a problem for you. I don't Well, let's Well, well, I mean, do you know what freedom of association is? Freedom to associate with who you want. Yeah. Do you think that that's an inherent right? Um, I think for corporations, corporations aren't people. So, I don't corporations are people. What else would they be? They shouldn't be people. I think that's where we disagree because in a some cases the Supreme Court has upheld that the corporations like have the same rights of people. So, if you own a company and you're religious, then you don't have to pay for like reproductive services or birth control, right? What else would you couldn't classify them as anything but people. People are the things which run corporations. Corporations are people. I I disagree. Um, I think that corporations are entities. They are run by people, but I think that they should be held to different standards. Is there any conscious entity that you can think of that talks and can speak like you and me and make decisions like you and me that's not people? Um, yeah, sure. Uh, no. No. So, that I mean, if that's the case, they're making the same types of decisions that you and I are making, why wouldn't they be assumed to be people? because they have different um sort of way like standards of operation. They have laws they have to follow that are different from people like in terms of the government's eyes. I believe it should be considered not a person. I think it there are just it's fundamentally the way that it operates is different. I mean it's not one it's like a conglomerate of things and um people who work in a company. So, like, so I don't have a corporation, let's say, then, and I have a private business practice, right, where I'm a landscaper, and I just, there's a woman who comes in, she's definitely qualified for the job, and there's a man who comes in who's slightly less qualified for the job, but I just kind of want to hire him anyway because I just don't really like women. Why is that not something I should have the freedom to choose for myself? Why? I mean, I just think we're operating at a different moral capacity. I mean, a lot of my things that I say are rooted in morals, and you're making yours vote like in sort of like laws. I'm asking you for the moral argument. I'm telling you that I believe it's wrong to make someone feel ashamed and not hire somebody and give them different outcome based off of their race or sex or But you don't believe it's wrong to tell people that they must do a thing they don't want to do? Not at all. No, I don't. Because I Because So then it's not about choice then, is it? I suppose if you want to make the argument you're making then no then it's not really about choice. Okay. So the second pillar of feminism is uh not just debunked it like so fast just like that. It's pretty Yeah, it's pretty false. You just said it's not really about choice. It's really about an agenda, right? What was the third pillar of feminism? Um well I think we're getting close to the end. Is this what we want to talk about for the last, you know, few minutes? Well, we have another 30 minutes. Sure. It's 5:59 right now. We have All right. Well, I might just have to take another break because I'm not feeling so hot. Is that all right? Um there. But I'll tell you what I would like to talk about next, though. Uh one thing here, I think it would be fair. I just told you I have medical issues though. Like I genuinely need to take a break. Hold on. I'm fine with you taking the breaks. Okay. But given the frequency and the duration of said breaks, I think it's reasonable to ask for an additional 10 15 minutes to make up for the breaks that have uh occurred thus far. Sure, I will give you 10 minutes more. We can go till 6:40, but other than that, I truly cannot stay longer. Like I have problems like Yeah. No, look, do you want to go ahead and take the break and we'll let some chats come through? Okay. Uh, all right. Uh, we're gonna Here's what we're going to do, guys. Uh, since we are getting close to the end of the show, make sure you get your messages in now. There's quite a few. Andrew, if you can just stay for just a sec. Uh, there's there's quite a few. Uh, we'll try to get them all in. Uh, we'll we'll do a bit more. So, streamlabs.com/ whatever. $99 TTS. Also, like the video if you're enjoying the stream. I need to do a quick sidebar with Andrew here really quick. I'm gonna put it on intro screen. Give me 10 15 seconds. We'll be right back. All right. Sorry. Sorry about that, guys. We are back though. I'm going to read a couple chats here. Uh, Riptor, the problem with feminism is that men overwhelmingly allow allow women to redefine what masculinity should be, while women often concede no such ground to men who have a preference for how women should behave. How is this equality uh since she's gone? Andrew, do you want to quickly like Yeah, very quickly. Um, I this is why I always tie them to virtues and thus far nobody has argued this definition. It's a big defeater for feminist ideology as well. All right, Riptor, thank you for that. We have Lucas. Here it is. Truth is, the little lady is weak and intellectually feeble. The other and otherwise mired in eco chamber with her views never challenged. Just a hunch here, love, but an oral argument in front of Scotus is probably not in the cards for you. Now, bring out the therapy dog. Um, okay. Uh, you know, I Lucas, I you maybe wanted that directed at her, but she she did have to step away for for a moment, but the audience uh did get to see it. And uh we do have a bit of a time limit here. So I'm going to see if there's any Streamlabs messages that we can let come through. Get the super bring in the super chats. Do it. Let's see here. One sec, guys. There's a lot. So I'll try to get through to all of them. Uh one sec. Ah, shoot. Uh we have USMConated $100. Big fan of Andrew even though I'm older than him. Member at Crucible. This lady hasn't had an argument since you hacked her phone reception. Lola. Yeah, we uh you know we've got what what Faraday cage in the studio, so they can't. It allows our signal to get out, but uh All right. Thank you for that. Christopher Murphy, thank you. Or Christopher Christopher Murphy is about to come through USMC. Thank you. Christopher Murphy donated $100. I'm a proud Crucible member. You and Rachel are finally getting the recognition you two deserve. Keep it up. Brian, don't apologize for being a good host. You're the man. I appreciate it, Christopher. Thank you. I I'm trying to be as fair as I can. Um, all right. Here, I'll let the I've actually had someone offer to pay me because I'm assuming if I leave early, you won't pay me. So, but I've had someone in my comments offer to pay me the amount that I was paid to be here. So, I'm going to go because I again I have medical problems. I'm not feeling good. What if somebody in our chat offers to pay you more? Do you think they would? Yeah. Well, they would pay me and then Yes. If someone offered, I would stay and I would cry on camera, but I don't know if they will. This is why we have the wage gap. This is literally why we have the wage gap, ladies and gentlemen. But I highly doubt that someone will offer that. I wonder. So they're they're offering you uh they're offering me 50. So So if you stay for another two hours, what what would that cost? Oh my god. Like 500 bucks? No. My god. More on top. like probably double double uh 500 or so thousand the original. Okay. Double the original. So I think we would need in order would you actually if if it was doubled would you if it was actually doubled I would stay cuz again I am like I do have problem like so I could probably stay a little longer. Two hours. I would just have to beyond. So we're talking 8 uh 8:30. Sure. Then I would I would need like triple because I I like Troy triple. You're a tough negotiator, Kylie. You're a tough negotiator. Again, this girl over here, tough negotiator. I genuinely do have shoes though. Like I'm not That's not a lie. So I just don't like to talk about it, but I like I have a hard time. Yeah. Like I could like What is the issue anyway? I don't really like to talk about it, but I've had like concussions and stuff like that. So concussions you are you brain TBI? It's well yeah I mean traumatic brain injury. Yeah it was a traumatic it was it's like I get like really bad headaches and like do you want we have like breathing Tylenol or ibuprofen. We could give you but I don't really want to go too much into it. Okay. Um but um I have had someone offer me but I just don't think this is a good environment. So, I think um I'll just take the offer that the person has given me of the original amount and I'm just going to head out. I think so. Yeah. I just um I think my health and is more important than whatever you've offered me, which is not much. So, I mean, I don't think it's fair. You know, we've been very generous here at the whatever podcast. I don't know if that's a fair categorization. So, you said the double. So if somebody does essentially uh somebody want to send in like an Ethereum and and again like this isn't really my network so I I don't think anyone's going to offer it. So but I guess you know nothing is impossible. Um are there any takers in the chat who want to see this? Wait, let me ask the chat. Why don't I pull the chat chat? Does anybody want another two uh uh 2 hours on top of so like 8:40 Pacific time? Pacific. Is it standard time or standard? Is it standard time or is it daylight? All right. Standard. I know how we can raise the money. So here on my notepad right down here. Okay. I have We're going to play hangman. I'll play hangman. Chat. We're going to play Okay. Yeah. We're going to play chat. Hangman. Okay. Hey, here's what we're going to do. We're going to play chat hangman. It's only four letters. That's it. You send in a hundred bucks. It gives you the letter. I'll put in the letter, but we got to do it quick. Okay. And then I'm going to rule them out. We'll play chat hangman. That's how we'll raise the [ __ ] We'll look. Hey, tell me. You got a better idea? You got nothing. All right, let's do chat hangman going. Let's Let's do a crystalall pop. A crystal pop. You got ogle in the chat. You guys have been lovely, but I really like again I need to leave. Like I'm not feeling good. But do you Well, I appreciate the debate. It was fun. Do you want to give a closing statement? My closing statement is that I love to learn and to meet new people. And I I wasn't putting my medical issue aside for money. I didn't know how long this was going to be. That was my fault, I will admit. But I appreciate like learning new perspectives. I was hoping this would be a more calm and demure experience because I've been trying to be more, you know, about facts and negotiating, but I appreciate the time that I've had here. Um, and I'm, you know, looking forward to learning more about you both. So, wait, what does that mean? Oh, I I just I mean like like learning more about like I I knew about your network before coming in. I had seen some videos, but now I'm more interested in like you guys. Yeah. So, um, what about this? We'll double We'll double uh but we add two hours on top. So that's uh it's like we'll double it. I'm not going to ask the audience. We'll double it. Whatever podcast we'll double it, right? Uh you stay. If I didn't have an actual issue, I would stay for the money. Like if that makes sense. But I I I like have to go. So I'm going to go. Like it's not like a money thing anymore. Are you willing to stay for Andrew's closing statement and a few chats? Yeah, I will stay for that. But can we make it five minutes? Okay, 10 minutes. That's fair. That seems fair. I I mean I'm I literally just here just We got Leonitis here. Listen to Leonitis. Then Andrew is going to give his closing statement. Leonitis donated $100. Kylie curious age of kids you teach. Also, what is a woman? Also, are women as a group oppressed in the USA? If so, how are you as a woman oppressed? If so, how? And are men as a group oppressed? And you said you're an educator. Are you teaching? Like, are you tutoring? I'm a private tutor. And I'm also a substitute teacher and I teach in, you know, three primary high schools in Chicago. Um, yeah. So, you teach like uh elementary school kids? No, high school. Oh, high school. Okay. Uh, he asked, "What is a woman?" Quick answer if you can. I think um a woman is someone who is I mean it depends like biologically female is different from being a woman but someone who is a woman is someone who's characteristically a person who um you know associates themselves with femininity and that is open to interpretation of who wants to identify as one. If I may just ask one clarifying question can a uh can a female become a male or can a male become a female? Like biologically speaking, I believe like you know the sexes of male and female but I think if a person wants to be a woman or a man. Absolutely. Yeah. Uh and then uh are women as a group oppressed in the USA? Your answer? Um I think it's possible but I really need to leave. Can may I just at least Can you stay for Andrew's clothes? No, I don't. Look, we're not we're not kidnapping you. We're just I'm just asking if you can at least stay. You have to clarify you're not kidding. Yeah. Yeah. But you said you could stay five minutes. Come on. I'm leaving. I I mean what? No, I'm going. But I hope you guys have a good day. Thank you for the experience. Are you oppressed? Do you want to just answer that? You don't need to say into the mic. Just yell it out maybe. That's my closing statement. But for a champagne pop, for a champagne pop, you guys were here for this. For a champagne pop, I will send you the Andrew Wilson notepad with a special note right here for all my feminist um little notes that I took along with the complete and total dominant victory. I win. I [ __ ] win. Just saying. It does say I just just want to point I win. I think that was a pretty I mean that's a pretty decisive victory. I'd like to congratulate you on your victory as the moderator. Pretty happy. Pretty happy about it. Not upset a bit. The thing is is like um I Why Why are they so [ __ ] you know these are the [ __ ] ass kicking? Oh, women can [ __ ] be in the military and ninja up men. They [ __ ] You get in a debate with them and suddenly they're [ __ ] crying and [ __ ] You barely say anything. Barely say anything. [ __ ] [ __ ] tired of it, dude. Tired of it. [ __ ] chirro on the one hand and then on the other hand they're so sensitive they just break immediately because you're just talking about you're having a [ __ ] debate. What does she think a debate with? You know what it is? I know what it is. They think a debate is they hit the mute button on TikTok and then just talk to talk at you. That's what they think a [ __ ] debate is. And you were there was like a both of you were doing it a little like uh mocking each other which is fair. It's a debate. It's rhetoric. It's rhetoric. I you know look uh she had a bit of a tone. The men do it. The men do. Hey, we want equality. Was there not a man yesterday who we were going back and forth? Lots of mocking going on. [ __ ] like that. Well, that guy on Thursday, too. Yeah. And did it look like Did it look like anybody was going quiet? Go. Well, you know what's interesting, Andrew? You've raised this point before, is that, you know, you're treating them as equals because you, when you're debating a man, so you conduct yourself in the same way. Exactly the same way. And so, you're giving her equality basically. I'm You You tend to word this a little better than I do. I'm I'm treating her exactly like I would treat a man, which is exactly what she demands I do. Which is wild to me. And you know, we've had so many debates now, nobody can say any different. Nobody could ever accuse Andrew Wilson of not being the same universally with men and women. And the the thing is is like look at the reaction and there's and they they pretend that they want give me a [ __ ] break. They the like a [ __ ] cheap chair. I barely even pushed on the world view. I barely even pushed on. She had 10 topics. I had one topic. We get to my topic first. The rest of it's going to be a critique back. And what happens? Folds right away. [ __ ] ridiculous. Andrew, let me ask you, uh, can you ask the audience to like the video? We need to like We need likes on the ladies and gentlemen, especially those of you watching live from the Crucible who right now are putting W's in the chat. And you better get the [ __ ] over here on whatever and put W's in the chat here as well. Please like the video and send in just hundreds and hundreds of dollars for the kindness of Brian. He did, by the way, on his own dime fly me out here. He did take care of the hotel rooms. We do want to we do want to we do want to play the kickback game. Remember the Crucible's motto is always we take care of the people who take care of us. Thank you, Andrew. Appreciate that. And uh by the way, I just you know, I was getting a little heat in the chat at the beginning of the show when I was kind of trying to mo trying my best to it's an impossible it's an impossible position for Brian to be in for those of you who think well that's not really fair or Brian's being too nice or something like this. Brian's job is to keep the debate on course. It's a way harder job than you think when you have such ideological distinctions. You're trying to keep the peace. Cut him a little slack. I've been in his chair hundreds of times. Not that chair, but been in the moderator chair hundreds of times, and I'm telling you, it's a harder job than you think. Guys, if you want, get in some chats here. Uh $100 TTS if you want. Uh maybe we'll uh if you're fine with it, Andrew, we we'll probably try to wrap this earlier than we have been usually, but maybe we'll lower the TTS a little bit. Let some audience questions come through. Let them roll, ma'am. Yeah. And by the way, I I I I win. Oh, were you playing hangman or no? Oh, you win. Yeah. Well, that was the four-letter. That was the four letter was going to be I win. I thought it was clever. Here, I'm going to read. Pretty good for a guy with an average IQ against a 150 IQ. You know what's funny actually, Andrew? The that woman on Twitter who was who she challenged you to do a IQ test. An IQ test. Yeah. And Brian contacted her. It was Jiggly and said, "Okay, I'll we'll we'll do it." He would get a person in here who was unbiased to give the IQ test. And guess who didn't want to do one? Yeah, we're She said, you know, I've been waiting on her to try to give me a date. She's not going to do She's not going to do an IQ test because she was a DEI hire. We have Kakashi. Thank for the super chat. Thanks to Andrew and Brian for pressing feminist women and men for their weak world views. From the outside looking in, seems like what these debates are asking feminists to do is uphold uh world views to a standard. Sometimes the answer is not it depends, it's relative. Thank you, Kakashi, for that. Lenny, thanks for the gifted membership. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. If guys, if you want, let's get it in. By the way, to once again the whatever audience for being kind enough to host me. It's always a pleasure to see you guys. Um, I know that there's a there's a bit of crosspollination where you guys come over and chat with me in the Discord from time to time. I really do appreciate that. All right, here's what we're going to do, guys. We'll do if you we'll do like Q&A for a little bit. We're going to lower it to a $69 TTS. Give me a sec to get that going. I'll let some chats come through here. Maybe Andrew can answer some of them. And I do apologize. I know some of you guys directed these chats at her, but she left. Nothing I can do, but I'll let them come through. Thank you, Jason. Appreciate it. Jason Castle donated $100. A hostile environment. What? Are you implying that you feel threatened by Andrew and Brian because they are asking questions? You really are Bos. You are trying to hurt their reputation. Real Bos. Well, and Brian did every Do you know why Brian tried to extend that? He was trying to extend it so that she could meet her agreement so that he could pay her out. That was the ultimate [ __ ] kindness. He was trying to extend it to make sure that she met her into the obligation and she just refused. She just adamantly refused. In fact, told Brian, "Stuff your stuff. Stuff what our end is in our deal. Somebody else offered me a higher bid. I bid you a due." And it's like, you think, "Well, Brian, why is Brian trying to keep her here?" Well, he's just trying to make sure that she upholds her end of the of the the contract, right? Yeah. And not I mean, not to mention also uh you know, we have we've had a lot of uh scheduled things for Andrew so far, but we had this scheduled for him today. He flew all the way from Michigan, you know, the flight, the hotel, all that. Not to mention his preparation for the debate, which Andrew does significant preparation for the shows and don't want wasted time and money for for either of us. So that's just Yeah. Anyways, um we have Michael G here. I live for the rage quit. Now we get quality bro time. That's right. Uh her asking the moderator she was a if she could leave is proof her worldview shattered. The patriarchy wins again. And the second the sec I can tell you the exact moment it was. One of you guys can clip it. The exact moment was when I said, "How is that not you appealing to the patriarchy?" And the the thing that she said is she went through it and she was like, "Well, it is true that we have to appeal to the government, which is mostly run by men and then went like this." And that was it. That's when it shattered. Just so you guys know, you can look that up. I took a little note in my notepad. It was right then that it clicked. I should actually I've got Patrice there. I should actually put a black crystal. Black crystal. Yes. Yeah, that's appreciate that. I'll just leave this one here. All right. There crystals. The pink the pink one seems a little gendered, Brian. You know that. Yeah, that seems a little bit gendered. Uh All right. We have uh Thank you, Michael, for that. Appreciate it. Uh let me I need to get everything changed, but I'll try to get these uh coming through here. One moment, guys. And guys, if you're enjoying the stream, once again, like the video. We have Christopher Murphy for the fund. Christopher Murphy donated $100. I tried. I tried the fund. Well, it's going to go into the Brian back pocket fund, which he deserves. He took um you know, he he he spent uh several for those of you who don't know, let me give you a little bit of backstory. Brian has spent several weeks several weeks. In fact, it was over a month. Um, you know, presetting these up in order to meet with my schedule appropriately so that everybody can kind of converge at the same time uh for the purposes of getting these debates done, the panels done, this and that. It's a lot of work. You know what I mean? It's a lot of work and you can imagine flying people from all over the country from different locations into one location, setting them up with hotels, airplane tickets, uh, all of that. It's a ton of work. You know what I mean? So, credit where credit's due. Thank you, man. We uh you know, a month in advance, all of these were planned and so far, I got to say, they've gone pretty well. Yeah, these have been some really good shows and uh yeah, there's a lot that goes into doing the guest booking and you know, there's people who are in, they cancel, got to bring somebody else in. And uh well, especially the the and you've probably encountered this because you request to debate people. It's uh it's difficult to get left-leaning Democrat feminist people to step outside their uh their mute button. Yeah. So, it's difficult to get it's difficult to get uh opposition who will debate uh who will actually show up and debate. Um and he he's right about that. Not only is he right about this, but let me give you um an interesting example. So, you guys have been live with me many times during the Tik Tok invasions. You might as well call them the mute Andrew invasions because the second I make a point muted and then overtalking. What happened here was immediately I can tell you how this went. It was this idea of social dominance. So the idea started with like you will not do this and the idea of me laughing and scoffing at the very idea that you're going to govern how I debate. That was it. The second it was the realization is well I can't control the tone. I can't mute. I can't threaten. I can't abuse. That's when it was over, right? And so then the world view collapses shortly after there because you you don't have any control anymore over what the opponent's asking or what the debate um you know is over. Where I take it or where you take it is no longer specifically up to you. This whole thing, all of this, by the way, just so that you know, was about one thing. Wasn't about no chick being [ __ ] sick. Don't be stupid. It wasn't about no [ __ ] health issues. Don't be stupid. It was about one thing and that was I want control and I don't have it and that's it. And for any of you who wanted to know what feminist ideology is really like in front of a patriarch, you just saw it. And well, in front not a patriarch, but in front of the patriarchy, right? In front of anybody who won't cowtow to a feminist. That's actually what usually happens. And then they go appeal to simps and the simps need to come beat me up and do this to me. You know what I mean? That's how they actually run their um their ideology, their ideological worldviews, their NOS's, all their bull. That's how they run it. All right, guys. We've gotten the TTS lowered $69 TTS. On that point, though, Andrew, um do you think some of that was um performative manipulation? Of course. Of course. But it starts with this idea. The idea was like, "You will do this." And the second the second there's no cowtowing. And I say, "No, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to have a legitimate debate like I always do." That's it. Right. What do you mean? I can't threaten. I can't coers. I can't browbeat. I can't do this. And then the second that Now, what happens when all of that fails? What happened? The water works. The final form of manipulation. Oh, I can't coers. I can't threaten. I can't do this. This guy doesn't give a [ __ ] He doesn't care if I rage quit, right? He does. He doesn't care. He's here to have a debate. Then came the manipulation. That's the waterworks. I health, you know, and I'll cry. But what did she say? I'll cry on camera for enough money. Don't tell me it's not [ __ ] manipulation. I'll cry on camera for enough money. Brian, did she say that? Yeah. She said, "I'll stay and cry on camera if it's for $1,000." Oh, man. That's wild. It's unbelievable. And like you guys, you guys, you know exactly what I'm tell you. See, how many hundreds of these have you seen now with me and feminists? It's always the same [ __ ] If they can't control or dominate, right, they lose their [ __ ] minds. Uh, Kaibaka again, I'm sorry. I don't know why Streamlabs keeps doing this. Uh, she looks like she gifted 20. Yo, Kaiaka, thank you. 20 gifted memberships over there on Twitch. We're We're going to let Do you see Michael, bro? So funny. I'll pull it up in just a sec. Let me uh let me get these Streamlabs, though. We have PeaceCraft here. Hey, PeaceCraft. Thank you. Peacecraft donated $100. I strongly support the woman's right to pro-choice. And you should pro-choose to get the flowers out of the debate chair after getting your bunnies paddled. Refund the degree. Almost for that, Mr. Peacecraft should be allowed back in the Discord mystery just for that comment, you know, make it so. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I can see PeaceCraft already seething. I do love you, PeaceCraft. You know that we have Lucas here on Streamlabs. Thank you, Lucas. Lucas donated $100. Appreciate it, man. One/ho screw the tone policing and her playing the crying woman card. Toughen up, buttercup. Dot. There are a [ __ ] ton of female attorneys that are total beasts. Do you think Camille Vasquez Johnny Depp to which he continues and it's hard for me to argue with that because I've had feminists across from me who go right for the jugular and they're brutal debaters and I'm like you know [ __ ] yeah here we go. You know what I mean? Let's [ __ ] do this. What a [ __ ] disappointment. What a [ __ ] disappointment. Right. Right. And you know what? She she could have just made arguments. Yeah, she could have just made arguments. I would have loved that. That would have been good, but half the time it was tone policing and yeah. So, uh, we have Lucas with his continued message here. Thank you. Lucas donated $100. Two/ dot dot would have wimpered out like this manipulative snowflake. You should be embarrassed. The world has no obligation to coddle you and cater to your weak constitution. Especially when you're saying that women are not in a position of privilege, but are instead the oppressed class and that they deserve the equality with men. You can't even sit across with one and have a [ __ ] debate. You I you guys, you don't even have a perspective because it's on camera. This table is really long across, right? We're not that close to each other at all. Like there's no there's just nothing. You know what I mean? Like the whole thing is [ __ ] cope. That's why the water works happened. Do you really believe? Does Do any of you really believe that suddenly this chick forgot she had a medical condition that she didn't previously disclose? Suddenly she's crying because of this medical condition and on top of that didn't do any research on how long these debates go even though Brian asked her, "Haven't you done research?" And she's like, "Yeah, the last two have been about 5 hours plus." So she knew. It's [ __ ] It's [ __ ] [ __ ] Mhm. Also, just I want to add one point of clarification. I originally reached out back I reached out to her March 28th of this year. So that's almost two months ago. Uh asking if she would like to come do a debate on our podcast. Um and let's see. Yeah. And I think we we locked it in. Uh, well, how does that feel for an almost 100 IQ guy if I'm lucky on a good day against a 150 IQer, Brian? How that must all of those degrees and all that big IQ, you know, to some guy who [ __ ] is drinking some mixed vodka and soda drink. Very masculine drink you have there in your hand. That That wasn't like a shot, was it, Brian? That wasn't a shot at [ __ ] Not a shot. It is a masculine. It's very masculine drink. Uh, we got Shaw here coming in. Hey, Chaw. Thank you, man. Your XD donated $69. What are the odds she was soliciting excuses to leave each break she took? Seems pretty high to me. I suppose in fairness to her, having your world view dismantled is pretty There's no way he's not right. I've been there. Oh, well, a couple things. You remember when her phone went off? I could I guarantee you she probably didn't end up using the excuse, but it was like, "Oh, somebody's calling me." Uh, you know, you ever like, "How do I get out of a situation? Okay, call me in 10 minutes. Tell me I got to go." What happened was made the excuse to go into the bathroom to make the text and then Right. That's Yeah, that the whole thing was Yeah, it was set up for sure. He's right. Tell me he's not right. Well, and what's weird though is who would offer to like the conversation was pretty tame. It was it was especially look maybe at the beginning it was what even at the beginning when there was a a modeicum of heat it wouldn't have warranted I need to leave but then that passed the conversation she was losing the debate but the conversation was fine. Yeah, conversation was fine. No need to leave at that point but whatever. Uh, we'll let the rest of these chats come through. We have But you know what she'll do? I tan donated $100. Wait, wait. She can handle teaching at three Chicago high schools, but the slightest push back and she gets crippling headaches. What a load of Oh, total [ __ ] That's a good That's a really good total [ __ ] Well, not just that, bro. like Sancho, let's point this out that um Brian was extremely charitable and we came down on her end. Came down on her end and was like, "No, this is going to go uh Andrew, you're going to A, B, C, and D." And I was like, "Okay, I'll conform to the moderator." Now, that's part of my agreement. Part of my agreement when I come on the show is that yes, I will adhere to moderation. And I've always been pretty good about doing that. There's sometimes where I get maybe upset with the moderator as every debater is going to do, right? But I that's part of the agreement is to adhere to moderation. That's what makes a debate fair. There is no [ __ ] way no way that this wasn't a setup, dude. Where she was setting up an exit strategy when she realized she was losing and losing quickly. M and with the phone also this do you think that uh and it hasn't come up too much in previous debates we should disallow phone usage. Do you think that that like neither person can use their phone? I think cuz she was on it. I think it's fair to I'm like I'm okay when people are bringing up stats and she's like let's pull up the stats. You got to have some way to do that. In a legitimate debate you should be able to pull up the stats that you want. But what happened was I crushed her with the stats immediately. And what what got her immediately was she was like, "Well, I just looked those up and I can't find them anywhere. Do you know how long that comprehensive analysis is?" And I'm like, "There's no [ __ ] way." And one of the chatters points out, he's like, "Go to page this, this, this. Everything Andrew is saying is right there." Oh, but I looked. She didn't look. What? She was not prepared for the argument. And neither are most of these sociologists who are feminists. They're never prepared for the argument that these people are [ __ ] wrong about their stats. They're wrong about the things that they're saying. They're not telling you the truth about any of this. Feminism has led to far more abuse of women than anything a patriarchal system could ever even envision. So, you think allow the phones? I think you should allow the phones for the purposes of stats. I don't think that like chat gpting an argument is legit. Yeah. But I think that if we're doing statistics or we're pulling up studies, I need to be able to look at what she's referencing. She needs to like I'm fine with that. Got it. Got some chat. That seems I mean that seems fair, right? Intel Wild donated $69. The only thing $150 about this chick is the weight scale when she I guess this is the roast the roast session. All right. Uh what do you think about this though? In we could say, and I don't know if this is too little or wouldn't be helpful, but instead of phones, no phones, each person can request to look up to three uh studies or should there not be? So, the way the way that I always did it was I would always say, take your three best support studies you're going to reference and then send those in before the show. I'll send them to the to your debate adversary. He'll send you his. Yeah. then both of you can have your reputations but anything external those reputations are unacceptable. Okay, got it. Does that make sense? Yeah. No, that makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. That's how because my studies come up a lot. Yep. So, what is uh when you're debating somebody, is there an argument like if somebody does say, well, where's the study? Isn't there an argument that you can make like I don't need a study? Of course, you can use you can use logical argumentation. You can use uh even intuitive argumentation. You can use all sorts of different arguments. And you can also say, well, it's an appeal to authority. Anyway, the second she said, "You're right. Sociology suffers from a replication crisis. You're right that it's about 60 70%." That's enough intuitive evidence for us to [ __ ] dismiss anything we're reading. You can imagine if I was like, "Here, this will cure you." 70% chance that it kills you. What would you take the pill? No. No. So why would you believe the study? If I said this is true, but there's a 70% chance it's wrong. Would you bank on the truth of that? No. No. No. No. That's it. No. And didn't you bring this up during the debate debate the replication crisis with a lot of these studies? It's they do the one and then there's a bunch of bias too like they're seeking. So here's Yeah. Yeah. So here's how this works. The problem with the falsification of science, and this is not the way science is supposed to be done, by the way. The problem with the falsification is this. If you have like a newer study, especially a sociological study, there's nothing that's going to come for a while that refutes it or looks at the methodology, that's going to take a while. Usually a year, sometimes two, sometimes three. But because this study hits the market, people reference it. They then ask this question, where's the reputation to the study? This is what current science tells us. But that's not true. It's not scientific. It's not really scientific at all. And the truth is is they present that as being evidence knowing that a reputation is likely right around the corner. That's how indoctrination works. That's why so many people know so much that isn't true. I started the debate by pointing out there's a reputation for this. She made this Tik Tok video not very long ago. I point out the reputation to the study. She didn't even bother to look up the reputation to it that falsified it. Said that it fell under the replication crisis essentially. And what do we get? We get like, "No, no, no. That's just not true." Well, have you looked at it? Well, no. How do you know it's not true? Well, I don't know. You know what I mean? She never even bothered to look at her own sources. It's affirming the bias. They always affirm the bias. So, always be careful when somebody says, "Well, here's what the data says." And then it's like a study from two 2023 2024. That's the most that's the most recent, but that doesn't mean it's [ __ ] correct. Uh we have a big uh Z here with a champagne puppet after the donated $1,000. Thank you, man. That's Champagne. Congrats to win, Andrew. And thank you. Enjoy. Do you want I didn't message that. Do you want the I win? Wait, I think Should we Should we uh We got to raffle the notepad. You want the I win the big And I'll I'll sign it for you too with your name. Do you want the I win notepad? Cuz we'll send it to you. I wish we could have her cope notes though. That would be even better. The cope notes. The cope notes. Yeah, the cope notes from her. Oh, yeah. She left her little Yeah, that would have been great. There. Oh, you got it, bro. There we go. All right. Brian, can I ask you something? And the audience is dying to know this. What? You've opened like 200 bottles of champagne and you still [ __ ] suck at it. How is that possible? How is it possible? You still 200 and you still suck at it. That was that that was a sub 302. [ __ ] ridiculous, dude. Look, you know what? You know what's happened? And this is backed up by science. Backed up by science. You're supposed to store champagne bottles on the side. Otherwise, if you store it vertical like this, the cork starts to dry out. Becomes very difficult to open it. And so, you got to wait for me. What the You got to wait for me, Andrew. I was testing it to make sure you didn't spoil it. That's backed by science. The latest studies say, so uh that's what's been h that's why it was so difficult to open them. I've now been storing storing them horizontally. So, uh, cheers to you, Andrew. Cheers to Z. Thank you, Z. There's only one way to do this. Cheers. Hang on. Cheers to Hang on, hang on, hang on. Cheers to the whatever podcast audience. It is through you guys and all of the viewers that all of this is made possible. And I sure hope to God you're having a great time because I'm doing everything I can possibly do to make sure you do. Saloo. Cheers. Even my haters. I couldn't have haters if I didn't entertain you too. Got a lot of chats coming through, so I'm gonna get them. Hoop, guys, if you want $69 ttsstreamabs.com/ whatever. Hooplin. Thank you, man. Hoopliner donated $69. Appreciate it. Andrew, if you could recommend two books, one non-fiction, preferably about logic, critical thinking, passing out ideas, and one fiction, what would they be? I would recommend Faith of the Fallen as the fictional book by Terry Goodkind. That's a great one. It's just a It's just a great story. And then the It's a little libertarian for my liking, but I would still get it. And then the first one I would recommend, I believe it's by Will Durant, and it's called The History of Philosophy. It's a fantastic book. Um I've read it a couple of times, and I really like it. Not just because they he goes into the arguments a bit but he goes into why uh the various philosophers started coming to this through their life experiences which I thought was pretty interesting. We have USMC coming in. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Use donated $69. She was a cheating bos. When she is discovered then she melts. Easy to see. Watch the video. La. You know what's interesting, Andrew, is uh two decades ago when I was in high school, I was on the wrestling team, and there's a there's a strategy that you can employ in wrestling. Uh it's called stalling. This is also something that you see in other martial arts, MMA, jiu-jitsu. I think a lot of what she was doing was stalling. She she knew probably pretty quickly that she was outmatched and some of her uh some of her tone policing stuff the you know breaks brakes stalling stalling because she didn't want to actually engage with your arguments and I think that's what a good portion of it was. I don't I don't disagree. I also think though like I don't want you to undermine or underell because I've dealt with so many feminists this idea of control. You have to understand like think of it from their perspective. They're on Tik Tok and and uh Instagram places like this where they'll have controlled conversations where all opposition is muted, spoken over, dominated. Right here that's not possible. Imagine the panic you would feel. Yeah. You know, wait, this person, I can't just mute him. I'm gonna have to actually engage. This is going to make me look [ __ ] terrible. Yep. You know what I mean? That would instill a massive sense of panic in somebody. Yeah. And how many times, Crucible Crew, have you seen this? These people panic because they actually have to defend the world. It's [ __ ] crazy. Well, I've seen your your Tik Tok invasions and and I've participated just, you know, I'll be I I'll have a one or two hours. I'll hop on TikTok and I'll just hop into these always on theudience. You'll get like 10 words in and they're like and then they you they mute you and if you they they mute you and then they just talk talk talk talk talk and then they eventually kick you. the criticism sometimes, you know, that here at the Whatever podcast we get some criticisms like, well, you know, you guys uh have kicked people out or you have we have an option where you can mute somebody, which has happened like a dozen times maybe total for people who are super problematic. Oh, it's often used not because somebody is winning an argument, but because they're like literally yelling into the microphone or they're just hogging the Well, but isn't that kind of like the most diplomatic approach when you think about it? The most diplomatic approach is not to try to shut them down or this or that, but say, "Hey, you know, the show has to make some money and haha, you know, somebody muted your mic." That feels very diplomatic to me. Yeah. You know, and non-abbrasive and and not to mention also because it's a panel show, you know, if one mic is muted, it other people can speak too, which is kind of the point. So, uh, but I mean, you've encountered that yourself. You've debated with, uh, Dean and DP. It's been hundreds and hundreds of times the crucible crew has run into the problem. Now we have a way in which we deal with it and um usually with those particular people we never have that problem again interestingly enough because there is a way in which to deal with it but the truth is is that I I'm not going to underell it because I think for sure there is a sense of panic which wells up when the control aspect is gone and you actually have to do the defense aspect. Yep. Got feminist lover here. feminist lava donated $69 150 IQ or BMI. Anyways, got put onto the pod after the recent Jire episodes and got to say you guys are both awesome. Keep it up and thanks for the entertainment and wisdom. Of course, thank you feminist lover. Uh interesting name there. Got Spyro. Thank you Spyro. Appreciate it. Spyro the master programmer donated $69. Not only did we witness why a lot of feminists can't actually defend their positions. You also just saw why software/ websites/v video games tech in general has degraded. This thinking is a mind vice. By the way, for because you don't know this, I know Spyro pretty well. I would actually consider him a buddy. Um, and Spyro has been working behind the scenes kind of tirelessly to expose what's been what's been going on in software, video games with uh the woke mind virus and why that stuff seems like it's so [ __ ] now. Highly recommend his channel. Uh, I think it's called, now you can hop in my Discord if I'm wrong about this. I think it's called Spyro Floropolis maybe. Um, but it's it's a great channel and uh he hasn't updated it as much as he should cuz you're [ __ ] lazy, Spyro. But you really should get back on that. Well, I mean, don't they just get into like the HR departments? But I mean, I've seen it. No, no, no. It's things like this. Like you can't say, you know how like you have hard drives on your computer? You can't say slave master drive now. Oh yeah. Like [ __ ] I'm not kidding. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Exactly what you're in. Uh the the chat doesn't like all my uh World of Warcraft references. But you know what's crazy? So, um, in I think we actually reacted to this on the dating talk. I don't know if you were there. So, it used to be World of Warcraft. I came out 2004, 2005, two decades ago, long time ago. The character creation screen, you know, when you create a character in a game or whatever, it used to have the gender symbols, the male or the sex symbols, male, female. They've now there's a bunch of other examples in this game. Blizzard is completely captured, ideologically captured. They've redone a lot of their art assets uh in in Hearthstone in uh to make it more homogeneous. They've changed the name of Well, so for the the uh gender symbols, the the sex symbols, they changed it instead from those to like just body type. So there's body type one, body type two, there's no longer male, female, man, woman. Uh they've renamed items like for example there used to be uh Finkele Skinner stupid what it's a and they changed the name because it was a reference to the Ace Ventura movie which he was making a joke about transgenders back in the '9s by the way. So, well, I would say this. Spyro goes like these are good references, but he goes in depth into the programming side of it, like the the what's going on in the company. Yeah. What's going on inside of the programming side of it and how detrimental it is and why you see such [ __ ] coming out for programs because it takes them like he explained it to me one night. He's a he's a [ __ ] smart guy, right? like and so it's hard for me to keep up with him but he's like look if I broke this down to you how these programmers have changed the language we can't communicate anymore it used to be a universal language right and now you have to learn all sorts of new code and this and that for the purpose of what nobody's even going to see it you know what I mean crazy you know you know what I was just thinking is maybe we could we should have tagged in Oliver but he he's gone yeah Yeah. Yeah. Oliver's gone. All right. Uh, more chats coming through. Being a [ __ ] gremlin. You're being a gremlin, bro. No, I was just saying. No, we it was we got most of the debate out of the way, so that was good. Murphy donated $69. Thank you, Christopher. Appreciate it. I'll give my left nut to see Andrew and crowd attack team a full panel. You're doing God's work, Brian. I just want to let you know, you know, you never know what the future's going to hold. Yeah, I I was uh Yeah, we we'd like to we'd love to have uh Crowder on the show. I think that'd be epic. All right, we have You might You might be able to maybe do a call in one day. You know, we'll do it. Tone Police Patriarchy donated $69. Thank you. Appreciate it. Very entertaining. Thank you both again. Brian is that lovely blonde lady that usually sits behind you around. You guys pay tax ever going to be on the schedule? Well, here's the thing. We've actually had Homath on the show. It was back in like 2023, I think. He did a call-in. He doesn't show uh his face on camera. Uh I'd love to have him back. It's just call-ins are difficult to begin with, but then that added complexity of and look, I'm not he wants to keep his uh which is fine, his privacy totally fine, but uh it it does sort of complicate it, but he's I love his content. His content's great. I've talked with several times on the phone. Very, very, very sharp guy, right? Uh enjoy his company a lot, but we're going to respect the ideas that he has around an, you know, his anonymous status. I think that's fair. Uh thank you for that, though. You do have to pay the sim tax though for mentioning the I think you're mentioning Felicity. So, uh Soncho, thank you, Soncho. Sancho donated $69. She originally said she had a 2hour drive back when Brian pushed back on her travel to her people are an hour away. She was flailing for a face saving way to GTFO. Gee, he's right. Well, the other thing is is that the uh so what we do is we offer to cover in the same way that we cover your flight in hotel. We'll offer we cover their flight in the hotel of course. Uh and so but if my recol I'd have to look at the message. Give me a suite though, Brian. You didn't get me a [ __ ] suite, Brian. It's a nice hotel. It is a nice hotel. It's a nice hotel. But Brian, you didn't get me a Oh, look at this div. But uh let me see where it is. Uh yeah, spring for the talent. What the No, it is a nice hotel. You know what, Andrew? I Plus, Jake is down here with me and we have a big announcement coming soon, but I'm not going to say any more about it. No, we got Wait, what's confusing to me though is there So when it came to the compensation for the flight and hotel, she mentioned driving we the the offer was to fly her from Chicago to Santa Barbara. Why would she be staying an like she would have had to fly? So the excuse was I have family who's ex away and I wanted to go visit them, but what's the distinction in visiting them 1 hour or two hours away? I have no idea. the show. But it's when she revealed, I know how long these go, but for some reason made the assumption that it's not going to go that long for me, right? That was she brought a laundry list of things to talk about that she wanted to discuss. Does she think that these this takes three, four minutes to debate these issues out? Yeah, we barely even gotten to that debate. I've been in this studio debating with one person for like nine [ __ ] hours before. Y I don't want to hear [ __ ] about this like couple hours we barely got to barely for debate content the long form debate content requires on each of these topics often times like a long back and forth as we deconstruct the various worldviews reconstruct them get the positions understand where the person's coming from it's not it's not so easy it's just like oh there's 90 minutes and it's settled and so Brian runs these long form and we sometimes have four or five hours debates. And you know what's really funny is like I'm an old man. Why? How come these [ __ ] 25 year olds can't keep up with me? That's what's [ __ ] [ __ ] That's why the wage gap exists. That's why the wage gap exists. That's why the wage gap exists. I make this argument all day. This is why I get [ __ ] hired everywhere. If I walk in with my resume, they want a [ __ ] robotics mechanic anywhere in the United States. When I walk in, they're like, "Oh, it's 12 hour shift." And I'm like, "It's not 14. It's not 14." Yeah. Uh, hey you says, "Thank you." Hey, you appreciate Hey, you donated $69. The stats are extremely important. I'd prefer if they were on screen. Remember, many of us are learning from the facts being shared and it helps us support our arguments against feminism, etc. Okay, but but here's the thing, right? What happens is the reason people are so resistant to send in their studies, especially to the opponent, is because they try to use [ __ ] studies like Yu-Gi-Oh cards, right? They're like, "Oh, it's blue eyes, white dragon study." Well, I have [ __ ] you know, brown eyes, brown dragon study, and that negates blue eyes, blue dragon study. And that's not how it's supposed to work. How it's supposed to work is that you send over, it's like a discovery, almost like a like court. that you say, "Here's what my arguments are going to be in my studies." Right? You can vet those and vet the argument. I can vet yours and vet the argument. And then you can really go at it. If people did that, we could put those studies up on screen. And I could say like, "Go to page, you know, two 221. Here's where you can vet that information and Brian could pull it right up on screen, right?" But just remember, not everybody's willing to do that. And so the thing is like me as a debater I have to be prepared for [ __ ] everything which is insane and always perform at a high level which is insane. But I do I would vastly prefer to be like here's my top three studies and here's my arguments. Here's what forest doctrine means this and that and just go at it that way. But it's it's difficult to do guys. It's not as easy as you think. We have Justin Martins say. Thank you Justin. Appreciate it. Justin Martins donated $69. You should use her fee to order Big Meanie Head Andrew a pineapple pizza so we can watch him cry, too. That That would make me cry. That would have been That would have been uh kind of the Yeah, pineapple pizza. Where is it? All right. Thank you, Justin Martins. We got Jim Walsh here. We tried We actually already tried to get you pineapple pizza. It was not effective. Jim Walsh $1,162 donated $69. Thank you, Jim. I bet a year's salary she was on Coke. She had Destiny Jaw and couldn't stop wiping her nose. I mean, I did notice she would I I don't think she was on anything. Wait, wait. You noticed what? Well, she at least a dozen times she'd kind of not I didn't see anything, but like she was constantly like touching her nose like this. I don't know if that means any that probably doesn't mean anything. Well, the problem is is that I'm a very beautiful man and so I was busy looking at the monitor like this. Yes. Actually, the reason the reason I often look at the monitor during debates, if you guys are wondering, it's cuz I'm old and I've been shooting guns for years and years and years and my left ear is my more dominant ear. And so I actually am the reason I'm looking this way and you'll see me look this way often is because I can hear people way better. H got Cha. Hey, thank you Cha. Appreciate it. Chaw XD donated $69. I'm a software engineer at a game company. My company is Philly with women who have never played games and hate players. I also was made to work for 3 months renaming repositories for DI reasons. Good god. Yeah, just data repositories. Really? Is that what he means? Data repositories. Doesn't is Spyro's stuff related I mean this go that wasn't Spyro then. No I know it wasn't Spyro but it's kind of related to the stuff that's going on with gaming companies for example. Uh is his stuff relate I mean this goes way back to like Gamergate. Well Spyro Spyro is a brilliant he's a contractor software engineer and he's brilliant. Yeah. So I'm not going to get into everybody he's contracted with. That's not my business to tell. Right. But he's he's been in with some of the larger contractors out there between every sector you can imagine, which would include like military, others, you know what I mean, right? And he he knows his [ __ ] like defense contractors and stuff. I'm not saying that. Yeah. Okay. Did I say that? No. No, no, no, no. Got Croj. Hey, thank you, Cro. 012094 donated $69. Asian game developers don't care what feminists think. Marvel Rivals releases female heroes with giant swoops and butts with zero care for what screeching feminists cry about. What do you think of it? Well, I think that it's like the like mustache man on Twitter that most people don't give a [ __ ] about mustache man. They just think it's really funny to watch people freak out, right, about mustache man. I think they just think it's really funny and so they do that, right? And I think in some ways Asian countries actually are trolling the United States, right? Like you'll you'll notice that some of the old Dead or Alive games in Japan or China don't actually have like the breast enhancement thing, but in the United States there's actually codes for the breast enhance. I think some of it's like I think they're trolling us. Am I crazy? I think they're trolling us, dude. Could be. It could be. I know in like World of Warcraft they uh there there was a a warlock pet that was a succubus. Yeah. Succubi. Succubus. Succubus. Succubus or it's like a female female demon or whatever. Yeah, that's the succubus. The incubus is the male. And it it was always a female, but then like cuz they're like, "Oh, well, this is uh this is sexualizing and objectifying pixelated." Yeah. demon in a video game. They introduced the male to the Incubus, I believe. Like you said, it's called just just stupid stuff. I don't know. They're changing the original game. It's weird. Uh let's see. We have Lucas here. Lucas, thank you, man. Appreciate it. Lucas donated $70. You have a second one coming. I'm sure it's probably just me being an old crotchety flowers, but I have no patience and tolerance for an incompetent, sniveling, weak weasel. This chick was the epitome of Chihuahua syndrome. tough uh is I don't know. I don't see the second one coming in yet, Lucas. So, I'm going to let yikes come through, but I'll hers up next. Thank you, Lucas. $69. This is how you know feminism is weak. Imagine MLK fighting for civil rights and the moment someone challenges his worldview, he threatens to walk out or has a man or started to try. Actually, this is a really good point, right? And this is a a good case of the idea of how women treat men versus how men treat women. The demand is that I treat this woman like an equal. So I did. But you can imagine if it was me in that same stance, right? I came in the very first night. I hadn't slept in 24 hours. I was sweating. I was all [ __ ] up because I hadn't slept. And I could barely even process what was coming at me. Right. But I'm like, got to do that [ __ ] You got to get through it. Right? That's part that's part that's part of how it goes. That's part of work. A different totally different mindset about how these things are done. And it's like um but from from her view at the same time she must be privileged and treated as an equal. And it's like well both of those things don't actually mesh, right? I mean it ties back into her her I think weak arguments as it relates to the wage gap. uh you know there no arguments. Well, yeah, men are just more willing to they're more willing to uh work through when they're sick. They're more willing to work overtime. And well, speaking speaking of what she said with the wage gaps, I want you guys to remember this framing. She starts the framing by saying this. There could be three different reasons for this. And I wrote it down and the first thing I wrote was like, "No, there could be 50 reasons for this. There could be 100 reasons for this, right? But it the framing was there can only be three. So what she wanted me to do was select from one of the three. Like [ __ ] it. I'm not selecting from one of your three [ __ ] reasons for the wage gap because that's all how you frame it. [ __ ] that. Here's what's actually going on. That's the right way to argue. What she did was try to frame it as a false dichotomy. In this case, there was a multitude of dichotoies. It was one, two, three instead of just one and two. But it's so it's like, you know, what are you doing here? Yeah. Yeah. And to your point, uh, you know, Andrew, you've been doing a bunch of traveling. Like you said, you came in that one day, you hadn't slept for, uh, 24 hours. You still did the show. I was sick last week. Still did the show. I was I had a terrible sinus infection. I had a fever. I When Jim Bob, it was uh Jim Bob, I think it was when Yeah. Jim Bob and Oliver were debating. My fever was getting so bad I had to excuse myself and go lay down. Yeah. And I was on the verge of throwing and I but I still came and did it. Still came and worked. Still came and did it. Still came and worked. And that's the thing is like I got off the plane and was like, "Oh my god, I don't know how I'm going to do this. I literally can't even think." You know, you guys know what what I mean where like you're so tired you can't really process information well anyway and you're just on autopilot. When that debate was over, I was like, I still won the debate. But holy [ __ ] man. That was hours of debating, too. Yeah. And just pure autopilot. That was just pure autopilot. All right, we have Lucas here with his follow-up chat, then we're going to get this here wrapped up. Lucas donated $70. Last call if you guys want to get one/ barking until you called her out on her [ __ ] Bravo, Spyro Synonym, Andrew. In my opinion, Will Durant is arguably one of the best somewhat recent historian. You think so? I I um I enjoyed the guy has a bit of flourish for storytelling, too. It's not just a matter of um you know how you can read some historical accounts and they're really [ __ ] boring. The guy has a bit of a flourish. I really enjoyed it. And by the way, it's my wife who picks up a lot of those books for me. Hey, I just what she'll do is she'll be out and she'll be like, I just saw this and I thought you might like it. And I'm like, I don't [ __ ] And I find myself at night, I grab the [ __ ] and I'm like, yeah, she was right. This is actually pretty [ __ ] good. Yeah. By the way, we still, this is one of our I mean, I think there's been a few episodes where we've had more than this. We still have tw uh just under 12,000 concurrent viewers just on my stream. Uh we peaked at about I think 14,000. I think it would have been great to keep going. Unfortunately, she just dipped dipped did the I don't know if it was a rage quit. What would you call that? A cry. That was a rage quit. Was it a rage quit? Oh, yeah. Okay. It's a rage quit. And in fact, there are other rage quits which were way less legitimate than that. That was a [ __ ] rage quit. Yes. Yes. Oh, while we have uh the viewers here, I do want to ask um guys, debate, I'm asking for Oh, well that there's that, but I need to ask for some assistance from any viewers who may be able to help. uh for almost six, seven weeks now, my Twitter has been uh I don't know how to exactly explain it. Basically, every single uh v video or photo I post. So, if I post any media, it gets put behind a sensitive content warning. My entire Twitter profile ex-profile is behind a what they call an interstitial, a content warning. I think there might have been one or two posts, not even my own videos. I was just uh doing like reaction commentary on something. Uh got flagged. I've reached out to to X. They don't have support. If anybody's watching who has a contact at Twitter X, uh maybe you you've worked there. If anybody can just maybe send me a DM either on Twitter that's whatever or you can DM me on Instagram at whatever or you can email me Brian B r i an whatever.com if you're able to help me get my tw uh my ex Twitter account fixed. I would be uh I will name my firstborn son after you. And if you're a woman I will name my firstborn daughter after you. Uh if you're a woman who Huh? What? Wait, what do you mean? Firstborn son. Yes. Not not firstborn daughter. The firstborn daughter. What if What if it's a woman who helped? You always name the firstborn daughter after the grandmother you loved. Everybody knows that. Oh, okay. That's like those are the rules. Well, then if it's a woman who helps me out, my son is going to have a really weird gay He's going to have a gay name. Uh, April. April. It's going to be It's his name is going to be Sue. It's going to be Sue. Yeah, I'll name my son a female name if it's a woman who helps me out. But yes, I've been having issues with my ex account. It's been scuffed. I've tried all the avenues I can. So, if anybody can help me out, get in contact with me if you're able to help me out with my ex account. It's been 7 weeks. So, help a brother out here. Help a brother out. Uh, help a Caucasian out. Also, go to Debate University. Buy it. Buy it now. Hurry up. Don't listen to Brian. Buy it. Buy it as much as possible. Buy Debate Univer. It's great. It's fantastic. It's awesome. high production value and also we're going to be adding to it soon. So, go buy it. Yes, get to that, guys. Okay, we have Michael G here. He writes, "Her right-wing dad owes Andrew a case of single malt. Oliver was a champ compared to her. Men are better feminists than women." Isn't that interesting? But here's the thing. In my opponent's credit, she did say that her objective is to win as many men to her own side because she obviously knows that that is the case. that mo more of the smart feminists actually are beginning to realize that they need male feminists to come in and make the arguments and dominance because of force doctrine. They literally need that. Isn't it hilarious and ironic at the same time? Yep. And then we have the state of things. Let's take it one step further. Women are so privileged that once they're taken down to the privilege of men, they're disrespected and shouldn't even dignify entertaining the men they're equal to. Right? which is the the like pre assumption there is that men are dirt and garbage, right? Men, they're dirt and garbage and they shouldn't even be dignified with an answer the second they become equal to men. Isn't that [ __ ] hilarious? Let's see if we have looks like we have something from Kevin here. He says, Kevin 89 donated $69. Thank you, Kevin. For the first time, men were the deciding factor in the presidential election. Do you think women like this are aware of how off-putting they are to the average male voter? If not, then cool lol. No. No. Actually, listen, they don't. They're going to double and triple down, quadruple down this ideology. I will say this about Oliver. Oliver, when I was uh after the show was done, I went um on the balcony to have a smoke. He came out with me and Jake and he literally said, "It's because leftists are so [ __ ] cringe and he's a leftist. That's why we keep losing." like they don't really realize to the average person who's watching it. Like imagine like there's ladies out there watching this right now. Their husbands are working their [ __ ] asses off. They get home and they're like this is how they want they expect me to treat this guy or husbands who are like why would I want my [ __ ] wife to ever be like that when you can't say the word Indian? Like what the [ __ ] That's how people normal people think through that prism. And it's like it's so wild to me that they double and triple down on that. Yep. Uh let's see here. Okay, guys. Final thing. If you want to support the show without platforms taking their cut, Venmo Cash App, whatever. Yeah. Well, let me ask you something. Sure. Okay. So, you get home. It's like [ __ ] 10-hour shift at the factory, right? And what you've been doing at the factory all day is some heavy ass labor. Let's just say that you're a hyo driver, right? And then and then you do stocking on top of that. Mh. So you get out of the hyo, you have to get off of it, on, off, on. You're driving this thing all around. They extended your shift another 3 hours tonight. You get home, your wife has a meal cooked for you, and you're like, "Oh, thank God." You're so exhausted. You sit down, you take that first bite, you haven't eaten all [ __ ] day, okay? You take that first bite and you're like, "Oh my god, anything would have been delicious, but this is extra delicious because she tried to make it exactly tailored how you want." You take that first bite, right? And you say, "Man, this guy at work today, we were talking about Indians." And she's like, "Native Americans." The wife says, "Native Americans." Like, doesn't now the food tastes bad. Now the food is awful and horrible. Like everything around you now is just like the imagine the sh like you you're about to take that second bite of the delicious meal. Now it just tastes like [ __ ] ass. You don't even want it. You throw it to the side. You throw the whole [ __ ] plate on the ground. Like the whole thing is just like you're just done right then and there. It's Native American. You know what I mean? Imagine coming [ __ ] home to that. Imagine that [ __ ] Just saying. Yeah. That'd be [ __ ] terrible. It'd be [ __ ] terrible. The way I thought you were going was she [ __ ] the steak up and she overcooked the steak. No, no. It's a beautiful steak. But here's the thing. Here's the thing. Even if the steak is beautiful, the second she says now it's Native Americans, it's [ __ ] garbage. And you're going to throw it on the ground. It's [ __ ] worthless. And [ __ ] that [ __ ] That's it. It just ends. It ends the whole experience. You know what I mean? Yeah. And what you want to hear is like, yeah, those [ __ ] That's what you want to hear. That's what you Am I wrong? That's what you want to hear. Just saying. Mhm. Yeah. Checks out. Checks out. All right, guys. Uh oh. Uh, go to guys. Twitch final call on this. Twitch.tv/ whatever.
