whatever that was just from yesterday's show and without further Ado I'm joined today by Andrew Wilson host of The Crucible he is a political commentator political satirist and Blood Sport debater his feminist debate opponent is Pixie as she goes online she's the co-host of the sugar spice podcast she graduated from University of Florida with a triple Major getting her BS in Psychology and ba in philosophy and economics now you can each have an opening statement and the rest of the show will just be an open debate slon conversation pixie will go first and then Andrew so go head pixie hi I'm pixie um I was asked to basically begin with a general world view obviously that's really complicated and really hard cu the world's complicated and hard but if I had to say what I generally believe in um most of my principles are utilitarian like the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people with the least amount of harm possible um other than that I'm a big fan of rols like veil of ignorance right if we didn't know what race gender whatever component you want to say and we're going to be thrust into society how would that Society ideally be um I just want to live in a world that is as equal as possible in terms of opportunity and you know with a basic standard of living that is my ideal obviously life feel a little bit more complicated than that um and even in terms of utilitarianism oh God party Foul tarianism um keep coming you're fine yeah I still believe how many utils did you just lose so many I going to the bad place it's negative 10 utils um I still think that we have certain duties towards you know our loved ones or you know our friends family members etc etc um but yeah overall I have more of a utilitarian perspective on things that's my my general world view peace out peace out you too homie sorry did uh did not mean to press that I had a move I was cleaning up the popcorn I was cleaning up the popcorn and then um then I guess we can get into your views on feminism yeah um do you want me to do that right now yeah for just your opening so I was just requesting that you gave me your worldview so that I knew what what prism you're looking through as you kind of tell me what your takes are on feminism Yeah so basically my general view on feminism is that we've made a lot of long strides when it comes to equality um I still think that there's certain like gender stereotypes or behaviors that we like punish um for both men and women I do think men are sometimes at a slight Advantage when it comes to certain power structures in place um because of old Notions of what it means to be masculine or feminine but yeah I just want to strive to be in a world where you know a guy can act sad or emotional and they're not punished for it and where a woman can act like you know straightforward or confident or direct and not be punished for that either um that's just where I'm at so just to reiterate very quickly uh your general worldview is utilitarianism the only thing I I just wanted to quickly follow up on is you said that you have duties does this fall under threshold deontology where you feel that there's duties up into a point and then you switch over to utilitarianism yeah basically I mean if there was one moral system that solved it all we would be constantly debating about this in philosophy right like this wouldn't be a thing that's still talked like in Academia for forever um but basically even though I ascribe a lot to like utilitarianism in the sense of what greatest am good for greatest amount to people um there is still a level of Duty that you have towards your friends or family um so for example let's say you get slightly more utility by in a hypothetical reality right this might not make whatever in a hypothetical reality um lying to everybody about your friend in a negative manner for whatever reason let's say that just produces more utility in the world um well then there's two things there I think you can probably still create a better world where you don't have to stoop to such a level to lie in a malicious manner um most likely and then second of all you also shouldn't do that because that's your friend and I guess what I'm trying to say here why I'm trying to get at is that um there's a way to be good to each other on a personal level that I think a framework of Duty explains better than a framework of utility so you could have a framework of utility when it comes to like general policies like on a large scale whatever um but when it comes to personally like how should I treat you should I treat you with kindness that's where you get a little bit more individualistic obviously sometimes these things can like contradict again moral philosophy as you know is pretty complicated in terms of like Academia there's so many different arguments I'm open to learning to talking more about it it's just obviously something that people still wrestle with a lot because there are a lot of moral conundrums out there yeah I don't I don't think that you could explain the entirety of your worldview in a single opening statement right I'm just kind of looking for the the key Point principles so utilitarianism the basic harm principle and then a threshold where it meets Duty so Duty has to be in play there in some points because you don't think that utilitarianism itself can accommodate everything okay so there's like a bit of threshold deontology all right so I'll dive into um to my opener here so I came to Christianity first logically rather than uh spiritually the spiritual part of it came after the logical part that actually is very common with people more common than people know um so to give you kind of my framework and understanding I'm an Eastern Orthodox Christian so that's the Viewpoint that I go you know look at the world from but I Intel wild donated $100 Andrew for all of us on The Crucible SL whatever side please wreck this woke leftist Blu head feminist Nazi tree hugging carbon footprint gender pronoun Kuma blue haired I that's where I draw the line for everything is fine but I clearly do not have blue hair she only has green hair sometimes yeah sometimes in edited thumbnails yeah so um so I'm an Eastern Orthodox Christian but to give you an overview of what that means I'm going to kind of accommodate Catholics and then what I would consider most Protestants would consider to be a Christian so from my world view knowledge is not possible without there being a god it's not even possible and here's what I mean by that without an an uniring standard or a standard which is unchanging your ability to know something is going to be arbitrary any St any appeal that you make any standard appeal that you make to anything ever is going to reduce to relativism and it's going to reduce to being arbitrary no matter what so because that standard doesn't exist I actually believe that there is truth which you can know and knowledge which you can know because I appeal to the standard which is unchanging the reason we're trinitarians meaning we believe in the Triune nature of God is because first in John 1:1 the word was with God and God was the word okay what this is saying is um if you if you move forward to 114 in John it says and the word became flesh so that would be Jesus Christ so in the beginning there's the word the word was God the word was with God and then in 114 the word becomes flesh so that means Jesus Christ is God right part of the nature of God John 14:6 Jesus Christ says I am the way the truth and the light okay so the key word there for us is truth right the way the truth and the light so in philosophy a Justified true belief is knowledge right I mean Accord Aristotle is the one or not I can't remember who exactly but then knowledge is a Justified true belief so you can have a Justified belief but that doesn't mean it's true so since we don't have a Justified true belief and we believe that the truth is God and must be God because that's the only inherent unchanging standard that there could ever be for truth essentially I feel like most everything that anybody tells me who's not a chrisan is a lie because it has no foundational grounding for it to be true it's moving towards some kind of standard which is completely arbitrary so I think that your worldview in and of itself destroys the ability the very ability for you to even have knowledge so that is the my worldview and how I see things now I'm not here to have a precept debate with you about Christianity right but I did want you to understand my viewpoint and how it is that I think about Christianity and I think most Christians think of it this way yeah okay I feel bad cuz know we're supposed to talk about feminism but I want to ask you if you've ever heard of gett your problems yes the thing is is that those can be reconciled through the Orthodox worldview as well okay so you're talking in the GTI your problems of the laws of logic having problems like um you could be half in a room half in a different room stuff like this but these are semantic issues right no no I or here let me give you an example of um a g your problem um so for example let's say you are driving by in your car yeah and then you pass what is it you pass a barn yeah and you say there's a barn yeah um it's Justified you saw it um it's a belief that you're holding and it's true except in this case in this scenario that was actually a fake barn and right behind it was a real Barn I know that sounds weird but obviously it's just a theoretical sure um technically your belief is still true you said there's a barn over there um but but can you really say that's knowledge did you truly know there was a barn there when what you were pointing to was in fact a fake barn but I mean that would just move into precept so whatever whatever standard implied knowledge that you would have be relative anyway so who cares if there's a barn behind it or not because it's going to be whatever you're going to appeal to to know that there's a barn behind it it's going to be an arbitrary standard which can be reduced relativism I mean does it have to be arbitrary I guess yeah you could never I don't see how if you didn't have a standard which was unchanging meaning could not be changed how you it wouldn't reduce to a relative standard um okay I'm going to put it this way mhm let's say that there is a certain period in time where you had this Village and in this Village they decided that like when the water falls down when you're getting water whatever um you should give it to the old people first because they need it more you know it's more important that they get water first whatever whatever whatever whatever sorry um and let's say over time everything gets better like their water systems get better blah blah blah Things become more evolved more advanced um and now that rule is arbitrary things change the circumstances changed but it doesn't mean that rule is always arbitrary what I'm trying to convey here is that no no okay that rule would not have been arbitrary so the meaning of arbitrary meaning without system or something like this but it would have been relative yeah and that's the point it would have been a relative rule so it wouldn't have been anything that you were basing it on other than some Metric you made up but even though it was a metric you made up it was a metric that was tied down towards like our physical reality of how we interact with each other how the environment is but could somebody have come in and said eh don't give the water to the old people first and they could have agreed to that right um they could have agreed to that but that doesn't mean that they did what was in the best interest of that means that the standard can be changed so if the standard can be changed standard is relative for instance the laws of logic can't be changed okay so so for instance can you tell me how you would change the laws of logic without appealing to the laws of logic first no no I I'll agree with you that the laws of logic can't be changed but I think what I'm trying to disagree with you here on is just because something can be changed doesn't necessarily make it arbitrary no no no arbitrary in this case if you're talking about the definition of has no system to it I believe that you can come up with all sorts of systems and then it's no longer arbitrary but it's still relative it's still made up and so what I'm saying is that the laws of logic are not relative they're not made up they exist as a metaphysical reality and they must exist as a metaphysical reality because they can't be changed and if you can change them I would love to know how you could um can I ask you a question on like how do you define this sounds funny or weird but how do you define like objectiv uh well it depends on what you mean by objectivity so like an easy way might be correspondence theory of truth that that which corresponds with reality you could say is objective there's many different theories of Truth which are encompassed in Christianity but I think correspondence theory would be fine for us to use as some definition for objective truth yes okay and just to you believe in objective truth you would have to because you believe in that objective standard so if you believe in a subjective truth and everything is relative than like for your moral standard what do I even care about your moral standard for yeah okay so cuz in my head what are you writing she's crazy no okay go ahead um where was I we talking about subjective yes subjective objective um what that which relates to an outside reality so I think um and we agree with this definition just making it crystal clear well I'm not sure if we agree on it or not I don't think we need to for the purpose of the debate I'm just trying to express to you what my viewpoint is as we go into the to the debate on feminism and showing that I I'm probably not going to agree with your principles of utilitarianism nor you with my principles of Christianity but that doesn't mean that if we both can look at like correspondence theory or something like that that which corresponds with reality that maybe we couldn't find some common ground here on feminism itself yeah I agree I I think just my main issue that I take is that when you are cuz I I also believe in objective morality but I believe in it I think for a different reason that you do um and there there's so many thoughts about the here I'll start here so basically I think my problem with your worldview or with how you're starting it out is that you're saying oh no like there has to be an unchanging God cuz then anything else is relative and therefore like subjective correct me if I'm wrong no no no no what I'm saying saying to you is that knowledge itself is not possible if knowledge itself the thing that you appeal to has an arbitrary metric knowledge becomes impossible you can't know anything if you say there's no standard which is unchanging for which we can know a thing by therefore no belief you have can be true because knowledge itself is a Justified true belief yeah okay so you have to so by having a subjective worldview from my worldview you have destroyed the very capacity to even have knowledge yeah and I think where the major disagreement comes from is that things can be changing but you can still know of something despite the changes how do you know if you if you can't appeal to it a standard from which if you always appeal to it is unchanging how could you ever know that yeah how do you know okay maybe you can help me answer this like yeah this beer mhm right can that be water no how do you know because I see that it is beer and I know that you unless if you decide to do some a bunch of like chemical processes essentially it's not going to so you're appealing to some unirent standard some unchanging standard which would say that this always must be itself like the laws of logic would say this beer can only be what it is which is beer right yeah I'm I'm basically appealing to this is where we're going to we're going to start disagreeing probably my experiences essentially and some laws of logic within like those experiences that I've had right so yeah your experiences are going to have to still be limited to the confines of knowledge which is still going to be confined to the loss of logic yeah but those confines are within my reality if that makes sense so okay I'm going to yeah that well hang on that's true yes yeah I'm you you yourself I think can have subjective experiences sure I think that you can have many subjective experiences but that really doesn't have anything to do with whether or not they're true or whether or not you have the capacity to know things if you think that knowledge itself has no standard for objectivity how the hell can you say I know anything if that is the case well yeah that's what I was going to get to um basically for you to state that there is an outside like external like unchanging Force you would have to essentially prove that to me why cuz otherwise proof to okay so here's the thing I I will give you philosophical proof that there is an unchanging Source from which we can always appeal to for knowledge called the laws of logic now if that is not true can you explain to me how these can be changed if they are subjective they should be changeable can you change the laws of logic or can can you not no I'm saying those laws of logic can 100% not be changed in your reality your reality the problem is in any reality you would have to prove to me a reality exist is outside of your perspective which you inherently cannot do because you are quite literally processing everything through your perspective like it would be an impossible task for me to prove that in any reality do you think that a thing cannot be what a thing is essentially even if those rules are true they're so confined to my reality does that make sense even if they're confined to your reality all I need you to do is Envision a reality in which thing isn't what it is which I can't but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist outside of the conf in all possible realities that you can possibly come up with it's not good enough philosophical proof for you that you can't think of a single one in which the laws of logic would not apply Andrew what I'm trying to convey here MH you see this box yep okay let's for the audience you are in this box okay and you're basically saying oh nothing outside this box can exist because I cannot perceive of anything outside this box but just because you cannot perceive of anything outside this box doesn't mean that there is nothing outside the box you are confined to the Box through your experiences this is just an argument from incredulity ultimately what you're saying is it's possible that there are things which exist outside of anything you could ever Envision and so therefore this thing may not be true that's just incel yeah no that's just incredulity it's a fallacious argument what I need you to do is tell me based on any experience subjective or otherwise exp I just did I gave you you you said it's fallacious but you did not explain to me why it's faci the argument from incel is a fallacious argument you have to explain to me why you believe it's facius you can't just say it's felicious okay because I could say I could be incredulous about any argument you make right you could say for instance I'm not here right now right and I go well I well I don't believe that well that's not an argument that's not an actual argument that's not my argument is a yeah hang on hang on do you agree with me that that would be facius argumentation um I would agree with you but that's not what I'm saying it is what you're saying you're saying because I can't Envision something outside of anything which can even be envisioned where the laws of logic may not be true you're just saying conceptually there could be but when I ask you to demonstrate a reality in which it could even be true you still can't even do that no because what I'm trying to say is that inherently every law of logic every experience you have everything you ever do must go through your own perception first okay but you would agree with me even if that's true okay you think that other people have perceptions right yes but I can never prove it from your from your perception you think but you do think that I can think that yeah but I'll never be able to Pro but you don't really need to you don't really need to prove it fully you we can just go off of your perceptions then if you can't prove anybody else has them and only you have them inside of anything in which you can Envision you from your subjective metric the only one which exists or is necessary can a world exist where the laws of logic do not apply no but that's here here's the deal right if we that's powerful philosophical proof by the way but okay of an unchanging standard which can be adhered to for know here here's a deal right if we can agree that even though I do not know or I cannot prove something outside of my own perception that's an impossible task to do um it is still still real to me right it is still something that is you know actively affecting my life I cannot just like pretend it doesn't um it doesn't make it any less real does that make sense that explain you could say you can say that but I'm just going to Grant it I'm just going to Grant that it's all real to you okay okay so even granting that it's all real to you right from what is real from your perspective can you change the laws of logic no no I don't we've already just answer the question no I did I did I answer if the answer is yes then that's the only only standard you can appeal to for objective knowledge right what the laws of logic yeah what other objective standard can you think of which is unchanging that's the point that I'm trying to get across is that even if there is a reality outside of my current experience which I do not know I do not know if that's the case whatever whatever um there are still these basic components of our experiences and yeah like the laws of logic in a sense are an experience right thinking like 1 + 1 equals 2 is something that you are actively experiencing going through thinking about putting together no I disagree believe that these are discovered they're not subjective metrics of the human mind but rather discoveries which you find because they're true yeah you're presupposing an external World which brings us back for hang on it I'm not presupposing an external world what I'm saying to you is from your subjective metric right now which is what you consider to be everything in reality which exists and that you could ever perceive of from that metric do you agree that when you pass away the laws of logic will still be here even if you can't perceive them yeah no that's presupposing that there is a existence outside or myself that's right everything is a presupposition which reduces itself to an uniring standard which has always been there and always will be there and always must have been there to assume creation or any justification for knowledge I don't think what is it I'm trying to think how to phrase this you basing your worldview off a presupposition that there is an external World which I don't even 100% disagree with what I'm trying to convey here is that it is our no no no no no you're presupposing that you can have this conversation right now you're presupposing that you have knowledge right now you presuppose everything leading to this conversation and everything you presuppose leading up to it has a requirement for knowledge which you presuppose baked into the laws of logic but won't grant that has to be an that has to be an uniring standard what else would you call that but God oh okay is it um I mean we could get into like a theological debate about God if you want to um well I I would like to move it to feminism right if I've if I have substantially answered your questions so that you understand where I'm coming from for my worldview yes okay I just I guess I'm just like a little bit uncertain when it comes to well I mean if that's the case then I would have to cross-examine what you gave us for utilitarianism which wasn't much yeah no absolutely could dive into that but I would like to dive into the purpose of the debate now that you know my worldview the world view itself wasn't to be the debate though I'm happy to do one in the future with you on this okay yeah um yeah the only reason but if anything we'll just circle back if yeah we can yeah okay cuz what my concern is that once we start talking about like feminism or worldview um I'm concerned that you're going to bring it back to God which is I make secular arguments okay cool awesome yeah great we're good then before we do that I'll just allow TTS to come Ulus is the Pagan donated $100 I give pixie prompts coming prepared and taking notes like Andrew I don't agree with her worldview but I appreciate her taking the debate seriously and wanting to engage well pixie I ran into her on quite a few panels in the twitch poll universe so I was happy that she was coming in to debate a thank you I'm happy I'm debating you right now we talking let's get into the debate so let's perhaps actually one question before we do that and I I think it is perhaps related to feminism I don't know if we've had you on the panel since pixie but this is something that we've brought on on on our dating talk panels very frequently the uh are you familiar with the man versus bear question yeah and so what the um okay our stream deck tripped out there so I mean perhaps right before we get into the meat of the feminism conversation I wanted to just hear your your take on that so the scenario is if you ask if you ask a woman would she rather be stuck in the woods with a random man or random bear uh quite a lot of women respond to uh respond by saying bear what's your take on this what's your answer to the question and am I allowed to ask what type of bear well it's a random bear and random man yeah okay um I might be wrong on this number from last time I actually researched this question or whatever I do think that the majority or the most likely bear that you're likely to run into is a black bear um if it's a black bear I would pick bear if it's anything but a black bear I would pick a guy is the most likely guy you're going to run into into predatory no but well then that's weird no let me let me finish let me finish um so the reason why I say this is because even if the most likely guy I run into is not predatory or whatever there's still like an unstable Factor there right um where it's like in most in the vast majority of cases with bears it see or black bears let's be specific they don't know they're really apex predators they will like they're basically they have basically no freaking clue um they'll usually like run away or stay out of your way um unless if you're like threatening a cub or something and it's mama bear though that's a whole different scenario um men I think are a lot more spontaneous they're obviously more intelligent in my opinion it could be the case where you have like a normal guy or something and then something happens to a normal guy you know maybe isolation in the wilderness for a couple of years could drive anybody crazy um and then it results into them acting out for example um it could be a predator or it could be somebody who you know doesn't really care like let's say it's a gay guy whatever um either way the factor is more of an unknown versus if it's just like a black bear which just seems like they'll they'll stay out of your way most of the time now if it's a grizzly bear [ __ ] that I'll take my chances with even like a predator guy cuz grizzly bears will kill you on site black bears will kill you on sight too the vast majority of black bears are pretty like they don't know they they don't realize they're apex predators it's kind of insane I'm not joking I did my research on this question I'm not Li I'm not going crazy you think let me ask you this mhm if you ran walked up to I don't know 100 random men on the street and just walked over and patted them on the head mhm versus you walked over to a 100 random bears in the forest and walked over and patted them on the head which one do you think would be more likely to attack you yeah the point is I wouldn't be patting the black bears in the head I'll make sure like I'm staying my proper distance from them with a guy um again as we've established like if black bears don't know that they're apex predator which the vast majority don't they're going to stay out of your way whatever whatever with a guy even if it's like a friendly guy like maybe he'll want to talk to me or like you know get towards me or whatever and I can't really ascribe his intentions with the black I can just like we can stay out of each other's ways so from a utilitarian standpoint though wouldn't you be far more likely to be helped by a man than a black bear um I guess it depends if I need help in that scenario well based on your current level of forest survival skills do you think you would be up to the task on your own I don't think the average man knows how to survive a forest either you think that the average man can survive in the forest a lot better than than the average woman um they're just stronger right they're built stronger they just do tasks that most average women can't do yeah but just don't have the required prerequisite strength right well I think women do have the strength to live in a forest just like how men have the strength to live in the forest but I understand your point you're saying let's say there's like a heavy log or something you have to move out of the way a man is going to be a lot better at that task than a woman well no it's not just that it's even tool making requires physical strength yeah but I mean like I can still make a tool maybe it'll take me a little bit longer but it's not going to be the end all Beall um but the point that I'm trying to get across or what I'm trying to say is that there is a chance that I might get helped but then I'm also you know rolling the dice on whether there's a chance that the guy is like [ __ ] insane and wants to like kill me or do bad things to me if you're such a Savage you can live in a forest if you're just dropped in a forest with no equipment and you can just survive in there then why aren't you savage enough to take care of yourself from a man what is it there's a very big difference between being in a forest like trying to scavage for your own like hunt for fish whatever um start a fire versus having somebody for fish if you were in a forest um if there's like a what is it like a freshwater stream or lake or something yeah how how would you do it um ideally I would find some sort of like small insect or bait or something like that um try to do something maybe with like the lining of like leaves or something basically like a little Rod maybe and use that to try to learn the fish that's how you try to catch fish in a forest I'm not an expert at catching fish but if our ancestors did it for thousands of years I'm sure that I can figure out a way through trial and error okay so I guess that really doesn't have I don't know where we were going with that that was it uh let me just let this TTS come LOL paladins donated $100 Weir to see pixie arguing w/ Andrew for the existence of God somehow I agree with her we are flawed humans and cannot know real objective truth and his plan for us is that objectively true is that objectively true L paladins cuz if it's not objectiv true then why should I believe it but anyway one one quick thing this is breaking news I've received word that Desiree from uh from the show yesterday who she in a Instagram story states she is raffling off the underwear that she wore uh fresh out and I quote fresh out of the ass I used to put Andrew in his place what the [ __ ] yesterday on whatever so make sure you subscribe and enter before I pick a winner Sunday night that's wild that's hor [ __ ] she didn't learn a thing anyways um sorry continue on continue on so anyway um over to feminism so can we agree to a definition of feminism let's just something really boiler play basic um so I give you my definition you can tell me if you like it or don't like it I would say it's the move towards egalitarianism with the rejection of patriarchal systems when you're saying egalitarianism equality and Equity okay I'm not sure if I 100% agree with it but we'll say then so then what's your your definition well no no I'm going to agree with it in general but um I know some people take that and then they bring it to an extreme they're like oh so you mean like um I'm trying to think of my example Are You full by the way because people Cal donated $100 presuming prepositions is preposterous I propose a pedantic posturing proliferated by poor practice must go back to school if only there were a university I could sign up to Bas around debating right that's actually a really good point he's saying that you're you're actually presupposing even the idea of the subjective being in the box has the requirement of knowledge so I mean that's the point but anyway it doesn't matter um over to feminism um the idea on feminism yeah the rejection of patriarchy and the movement towards egalitarianism do you agree yeah I I was going to say I'm going to assume that we're being like good faith right now because some people will be like oh you know you want like equality and like Equity do you mean and then maybe that means I don't want Equity I'm not sure um but oh like you believe in that that means that um you know you think like a both a guy and girl despite of their qualifications should be in the same like you know military bracket or whatever I'm using a random example and it's like well no only if they meet the requirements to be in that bracket does that make sense like people will take it and think that I mean on the on the basis of gender it means that they should be exactly 100% the same even if they're not as equally qualified yeah I don't think men and women are interchangeable Widgets or that feminists even say that they are okay okay just clarifying okay we're good then yep so I mean I think I think that that's fine okay right um so if if your your idea there is that their ontology is different men and women their being is different I don't what do you mean by being like well they're not inter well they're not interchangeable widgets so whatever what we would call TS or purpose or the things that they're interested in maybe from your perspective are going to be different than the things women are interested in and that's going to be somewhat yeah I'm cuz otherwise then we do have a problem of you thinking they're interchangeable widgets so if you think their ontology is exactly the same that men and women are exactly the same then we do have a problem yeah I so I think if I had to draw it out again I would say that do a lot of drawing yeah I like drawings go ahead there's probably like a scale of behaviors let's I don't even like doing it this way but I'm going to put man woman even though though I think this is dumb because I think there's just human behaviors in general that both men and women per like have but I think there's like talking about a gender scale yeah essentially um x amount of these qualities make you a woman x amount of these qualities make you a man well no that's why I'm saying that's where I would disagree I would say that there's certain behaviors that are just human behaviors that both men and women have yeah I agree so I I would say anything that you would consider like a gendered emotions nonsense anything you'd consider specifically a gendered behavior would be nonsense right like if you you can have Tom girls for instance they're still females you can have men that do little [ __ ] tea parties or whatever they're still men right they're still males so I would agree with all of that right so I I don't think that there's a specific em I just think that the men and women perceive them differently and that men and women are built differently yeah from conception they're built differently their brains work differently and their bodies are different yeah I think um there's definitely differences in body especially in strength the brain argument is a lot more complicated cuz then it becomes a question of like nature versus nurture like the whole idea of like female and male brain is like pretty contentious um a lot of it like yeah but if you have one sex that's stronger right physically stronger on average and the male sex is much stronger on average than women now it's significantly stronger the tailoring of society necessarily around that would create different interest interest right um yes at certain points I think the problem is that as we have a society has involved and as we've had like more like let's say Machinery or even like other things have just come and spawned essentially um are DNA and like biological predispositions also somewhat slightly change even if it's like ever so slightly so do you know like epigenetics yeah but I mean epigenetics wouldn't even EXP this in 60 years that's that's that's that's insane even from even from an EP epigenetic standpoint well from an epigenetic standpoint like our genes are like you know they're constantly changing to our environment basically um it doesn't happen in one generation it doesn't happen in one generation or or three no well it it can happen pretty quickly I mean there's like what is it epigenetic studies on like for example women who have had um children or we're got you got to do me one favor though yeah you got to say women and not woman I am English is my second language you got to say women and not women okay call me out all right um women women women women w m e n wman no no that's that's I could say muh if that's easier in Spanish just say women women I swear to God I'm not being crazy right now all right all right fine it's not me trying to be an [ __ ] it's just it's second language um there's epigenetic studies of women who [Laughter] um um you know who are let's say like pregnant or whatever during like a time of strife starvation resources are low and like how that like literally genetically affects their offspring to be able to like retain like fat better for example um or like basically things that could happen within like one gener essentially um or that wouldn't apply to the societal social characteristics of the entirety of a Nation when it came to the interest of men and women well what I'm trying to say is that if we can already see things like that within like one pregnancy and see like DNA changes then it's not a giant leap of faith to assume that like over time especially as Society has like more and more changes you'd start seeing yeah you'd start seeing what kind of changes well what kind of changes would you expect to see let's see in a society where physical labor and force becomes less important essentially like right now yeah or like how it has been what would you expect to see yeah you would expect to see um basically societies that start centering intelligence as a more important component um or start selecting based to more on you know expected intelligence whatever than just pure brute strength yeah but society's not becoming smarter I don't know about that yeah I know about that IQ slated to continue to reduce on average where inre well I'll give you the numbers yeah but not only that let me bring this up as well don't get me just the numbers get me the study yeah yeah but let me give you the the numbers on this as well this is all CDC information by the way if I were to take what you're saying at face value that necessarily through epigenetic leaps that um men and women women by the way would suddenly begin to have different interests not suddenly it would it would be gradual over time well but how you said what do you mean gradual like how long because you said it could happen very happen very quickly well how quickly it could it could it could theoretically or certain certain changes could happen within a generation yeah so this is CDC info most female jobs this is according to the I'm sorry the BLS these jobs have the highest percentage as a society as a whole if labor is less important because we have Machinery to do it instead you would find both men and women more in service sector jobs which we have seen not you're seeing mostly women in those jobs and that's what I'm going to show you yeah no you the amount of men who are now like in stem in general like the United States as a whole is a service been in stem men have always been Domin not not always we have seen have always been dominated I'm I'm I'm saying that doesn't matter because I'm saying that when we compare manual labor jobs to service jobs we have seen a vast increase in service-based Jobs versus manual labor jobs in the United States that is just objectively true that that wom women do which is the exact same jobs they were always have also done more service-based jobs more people are lawyers doctors wait wait wait wait wait men have always been in those fields always maybe I'm not explaining my point clearly enough the point that I'm trying to get across is that as manual labor has become less important in the United States there is an increase of men doing more of those jobs so before it might have been like hey maybe I'm going to go let meish this makes the argument makes no sense I'll I'll I'll steal man the argument that way you know I understand it the argument that you're making is as these other service sectors have opened up men are gravitating into those service detectors instead of just manual labor right yes then how come women aren't gravitating towards the manual labor sections because the manual labor sections have been either taken over by technology no they Haven or Roofing has Roofing been taken over by technology no but what is it it doesn't necessarily I'm trying off has construction been taken over by technology Roofing has has even gardening basic gardening what about lawn mowing lawn care uh almost in fact almost all labor I can think of which now is heavily inundated with machines still totally dominated by men almost there a lot less men in average doing those jobs compared to before because you have had Machinery replaced if it took three AR if it took five men to redo a roof or whatever now it takes two right yeah why isn't one of them a woman no because the point is as a society as a whole we have just moved away from manual labor so obviously AR makes no sense yes it does make sense it's very simple okay give it to me again yeah here okay manual labor jobs have become less important we have found technology to basically help replace a lot of the brute force or strength that we needed before agree so the vast majority of people um men and women are now more inclined towards service sector jobs okay so I I don't understand though are you implying that women were doing manual labor jobs no I'm not implying women were doing if that is true and women were not doing manual labor jobs before and now you have Machinery which are assisting in these manual labor jobs why aren't women gravitating towards those jobs well all you're saying to me is as manual labor jobs have decreased all right because the market demand men who ordinarily would take those jobs move into things which aren't manual labor that is not a [ __ ] argument at all for any epigenetic stride at all that's just I'm going to take this thing away so now now you have no access to it cuz it's not available so you have to do something else that doesn't mean that their interests still aren't here it just means it's not available why aren't women taking those jobs still especially if they're less physically demanding the argument that I'm trying to make is as a whole our society has decided to put more value on the service labor jobs that's why you're not going to see women well first of all what would that have to do with anything I'm I'm serious if the is Andrew you can either become a doctor or you can do roofs sure the doctor will pay better are those choices available to men and women what to do the doctor doctoring or the roof okay so I understand so I understand if there's less jobs available to do roofs which there there aren't right but I mean there's still plenty of jobs to do roofs but even if there was less of them so now the men who wouldn't ordinarily be doing roofs go ah [ __ ] I got to go be a doctor now so they go may be a doctor now you have eliminated this option for them so this is what they can do why are women who can do both only doing the doctor and not doing the construction part because our society elevates the freaking doctors that's why our society and I'm not saying this is right I'm not saying this is necessarily how it should be but yeah our society tends to Value things that are more service based than manual labor based so this argument we value our CEOs more than we Val wait wait let me finish we value our CEOs more than we value our janitors for example so let me get this right even if it were true that we put the value and we do right we put a value on doctors and lawyers more than we do like garbage men and [ __ ] like that I is there's no way in hell you're assuming that every woman is so smart that they're going to be able to be the doctors and lawyers right no I never said that so how come none of them it's not none obvious just statistics right now it's not zero I've got them right now let do it do you think that 98 [ __ ] per I never said that I never I never gave a specific number I'm getting used to specific numbers preschool the number is obviously Noto kindergarten teach them you're exaggerating listen preschool kindergarten teachers 98% women 98% women can you send us that so we can pull it up for the audience yeah okay but none of what you're saying is contradict what I'm saying yeah whereit so how many rough necks let's find out how many rough necks are there wait let me finish before I forget here's the other thing is it Rachel who's sending it or what's that the no I'm sending it to you what do you mean you just told me to yeah yeah no but yeah so here's a couple send it to our Instagram if you can here's a couple things to break down also um what is it women are also a lot less likely to apply towards jobs that are male dominated fields for a variety of reasons you could say some of them are just not interested in it sure even for women who aren't interested in it which is more of a minority um yes you are more likely to experience sexual harassment or just sexism in general the more male-dominated a field is so you're less likely to get hired and even if you are hired you're more likely to be looked down upon so there are a combination of factors which I've never denied that even I said it multiple times I never denied that women are less into these fields no you gave a descriptor that because of epigenetics what's going on is that no well I said so I'll let you finish and then I'll go okay you gave me a descriptor I asked you this question specifically the question was why is it that you think that this is happening and this is in regards to why women are taking these fields men are taking these fields your descriptor for this was because through epigenetics through genes their interest can suddenly change suddenly change and that that's what's going on because now society's valuing different things I'm granting the argument as being true for the purpose of internally critiquing it so here's what I see I see you saying this we have five construction workers and then we have a robot the robot comes in takes the job away from two of those now we have a doctor's slot over here okay the women who are on this side who are in I don't know they're [ __ ] coffee Baristas or something there's five of them okay robot comes in takes two of those jobs away now there's three of them now you're saying they're both competing to be doctors okay I agree but how come the women who are the Baristas of what you're saying is true about epigenetics aren't coming in to take those three jobs of the construction workers or the construction workers going in to take the three jobs of the Baristas that's the [ __ ] question that I that you are not actually answering yeah no the argument that I was trying to make is that the reason why people are not trying to suddenly jump into another um labor job or whatever is because as a whole both the men and the women are trying to get into the nice Ser night I'm not saying it's actually nice but whatever the nice service based jobs instead because that is where the fame notoriety whatever you want to call it so societal respect let's put it that way is that yeah but I've already granted that this is the case so let's just I'm just going to assume that men and women both want to be doctors yeah but you can then Grant to me that almost nobody's ever going to be a doctor um yes sure so that would be men and women but there's what is so so if it is the case that almost no men and no women are going to be doctors and they're not going to be in high status jobs lawyers doctors professionals like this most of them are going to be in the service industry or they're going to be working in factories and construction and [ __ ] like that they going to be more specifically how come we don't see from these ends any crossover into these other fields in fact they seem to be more inundated along gender lines for construction than ever before yeah and like I how I stated before there's two reasons for this because of a person person can escape or if there's opportunity for them to escape the manual labor they're going to most likely take it than not they don't men aren't taking it you think they have to do it what do you mean by they have to do it like could they go they could go be a [ __ ] waitress yeah no what I'm also saying is that there's also other combinations or other factors that like how I was saying before for example women um even the ones that are interested because the number isn't zero it is low however I will grant that um so so low as to be abysmal like almost none in many of these cases like rough necks for instance there's basically none line line workers for instance on power lines basically no females at all yeah the point that I'm trying to get across is that there's other barriers also in place well let's get into those finish let me finish please um so what is it when it comes to a lot of these women or when it comes to breaking into male-dominated Fields um the more men there are the higher rates of sexism a woman is more likely to experience or just straight up sexual harassment there is usually a direct correlation with those some of it could just be straight up interest maybe not as many women are interested in doing um those jobs essentially um there but I thought epigenetics was going to take care of that interest problem well what I was trying to describe before when it comes to first of all that's not how I was using epigenetics originally but even if I was um my here my original argument for epigenetics was that we might see a slight difference in interest over time but that would be regardless regardless said wait let me finish okay regardless of that um even if I did 100% Grant whatever you were saying you would see the biggest leap not in between oh other manual manual jobs you would see the biggest leap into as what we were describing before service based jobs because service based jobs are the ones again with the more Prestige the more value the more societal respect so that's why we wouldn't see inter Crossing you would just see people trying to move up instead yeah that makes no sense if you have a barrier for entry inside of those service level jobs that you're talking about meaning you and I both know that not everybody can be a doctor or a lawyer or in one of these high status fields you should actually see the interconnecting why wouldn't you why wouldn't you you say because there's a a barrier to entry to be a construction worker female what barrier no no what I'm trying to describe here if we're saying okay epigenetics your genes or yeah whatever your offsprings genes even your genes can change depending on the environment um even ever so slightly um over time our society starts valuing X quality just let's say they value X quality people are going to start selecting for that quality more right or your jeans are going to respond to that quality more essentially men and women right so if ex quality is essentially intelligence um that's what more of society is going to start leaning and focusing more towards they're not going to be focusing on the other manual labor job they're going to be focusing more towards the intelligence-based job got it so both both men and women want they're selecting for ex quality they want to move towards being doctors and lawyers got it yes however this still does not answer my question which is this why is it that women still even if they're competing for these uh neutral jobs that they can do because they require zero [ __ ] physical strength they sit in in an office building all day being a lawyer doctor whatever it is why is it that you don't see them competing to be line workers why don't you see them working on power lines Why don't you see them working on oil rigs those are extremely highp paying jobs even for dumb women way higher paying jobs than being a [ __ ] coffee Barista or somebody who works at a wait as a waitress there's no more barrier for entry why aren't they crossing over that would make no sense why wouldn't they do that there's a couple of reasons like I listed before some of it can be based off of Interest maybe not as many women are interested in doing those things why not um what is it there a million reasons maybe some of them do have a biological predisposition to not be interested in that biological predisposition so something to do with their ontology some some some other ones um might be raised in a household where they're taught hey that's not a very ladylike thing to do you should focus instead on like you know taking care of children like that's more you know that's the more ladylike thing to do so their interest might develop more into that field basically um rather than having it being a biological innate thing so for some people might be biologically innate for some other people it might be just a result of society that's really weird is pornography a ladylike thing to do um what is it it's not necessarily ladylike but it is highly rewarded yeah it's highly reward so is being a person who works on an oil rig highly reward or or hang on hang on let me finish now I just let I'll let you finish I'll let you finish go for it just like working on a fishing boat just like working at at you know in the world's deadliest catch you don't see any women doing any of these or working as an ice trucker here's why here's what's so interesting to your argument pornography is not ladylike in any way shape or form so your argument of wait a second they're told that X thing is not ladylike it seems that women will ignore this isn't ladylike if it leads to a lot of [ __ ] money if it leads to ACH of money suddenly the it's not ladylike we can put a big [ __ ] X through it so if we can put a big X through doesn't seem very ladylike because we will compensate for that with money why the [ __ ] wouldn't they go do that with other job is it because they can't just say say Andrew let me finish right let you finish now it's my turn so I use the word ladylike but the truth is if a woman tries to go into the [ __ ] oil rig whatever field um yeah a lot of guys are going to straight up laugh at her not even give her the opportunity to prove herself basically be like hey you're a [ __ ] woman and again as we stated before yeah more male dominated Fields tend to be more discriminatory towards women so even a woman who could do those things and is physically capable of doing those things will probably get [ __ ] laugh hey no let me finish wait let me finish please we'll probably get laughed out I've been interrupting you too much yes okay um I'm just being playful so hang on so wait no no no I just want to test this real let's do one point at a time you said three points I just want to respond to those three points and then you can respond to everything you want um then in addition to that oh yeah women are very much rewarded also somewhat society when they do pornography okay that's straight up you have a lot of guys being like Oh like you're so hot you're so sexy oh my God like that's you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen it's still positive reinforcement versus if you're a woman who works in an oil field you somehow get in there you're not left off whatever um you make that bag you make that money you're still going to be people being like really like that's a that's the field you chose while pornography you still have a [ __ ] ton of people in our modern society being like wow you're so hot yeah I can put this to the test though but by the way um that's really weird because that would be the barrier entry of politics all sorts of things which are male dominated women come in and instead they're glorified the opposite happens they're not repressed they're [ __ ] glorified here's an example of this do you have you heard of the first female Navy SEAL do you know her name no okay she doesn't exist that's why you've never heard her name because not a single woman even though the Navy has done everything in its power to recruit women to be Navy Seals treat them like [ __ ] gold and put out every ad you can imagine they want one in the worst way so they can be like this is the first one none of them can actually do the training none of them been able to actually accomplish the feat of being able to pass basic underwater demolition school so there's no female Navy Seals not one so the thing is is that your argument here of but wait they'll be laughed at they have every government incentive on planet Earth to not be laughed at oil rigs will be given incentives for instance linemen will be given incentives for instance to bring women on instruct their staff to train them every which way possible give them massive incentives and women just physically can't [ __ ] do the job yeah no I said in the beginning there so this idea that it's stigma need you to answer to the idea of how you can have massive government programs doing everything they can to bribe the employer to bring women on and which reduces the stigma to like something non-existent and somehow though somehow though you you think that they're just afraid they're going to get laughed off the line there's a couple of things to break down here okay first of all just saying oh no you see they have incentives to like not be stigmatic doesn't necessarily take away the stigma as I stated before a lot of it like it's basically coor no I'm sorry you have like who's getting the incentive it's what is it the oil company let's say per se whatever um it's not NE necessarily the daily lineman worker that is going to be interacting with this woman so you can have government incentives that doesn't necessarily take away the social stigma um even with that like what I stated before yeah a lot of women can't necessarily physically do it I'm not disagreeing with that I think the biggest difference between you and me right now is that I'm saying there could be a variety of reasons some of them physical strength some of them societal pressure while you're saying no it's only because they can't social stigma doesn't exist which is insane to me wait wait you're strawmanning my position I never said that there couldn't be more than one reason I was you attacking me so hard when I because I'm starting with my first reason which is that men and women are not interchangeable women or units they're not interchangeable widgets and almost no women almost none have the physical capability to do a lot of these jobs that men are doing that almost none maybe some outlier somewhere that I don't know about but almost none do but I don't disagree with that to say various reasons so then if you don't disagree with that you agree with me that men and women are not interchangeable widgets which how we got on this to begin with yeah like I never what is got it so then so then if that is the case then they must be it Society is going to tailor itself around people's purpose and if men are incredibly strong can do these jobs because you agree with me that most women can't then that would kind of say that Society is going to form itself around the purpose of men at that point right and as I stated before when it comes to the whole idea of like oh presupposed purpose as Society also changes the purpose of both men and women will change as well because Society has changed so as how we got here in the beginning critical infastructure has changed the necessary requirements for what is it critical infrastructure has absolutely changed in the sense of oh it's no longer brute strength we have maery no it what Machinery is going to lay a roof what do you mean I mean eventually but it's not it's not impossible wait wait no no no wait it's not impossible for a woman to do roof you're no no okay I'm not off good then let me go down then let me go down my series here you're acting as if it's impossible for a woman let my Series yeah okay so what I'm saying to you is almost no women anywhere anywhere on planet [ __ ] Earth can do roof work almost do you think they're physically incapable of okay I disagree I think there's definitely jobs that women are less inclined to do um rescaling a roof I'm pretty sure we can like find out multiple examples of women doing it I think most women are not inclined to do it maybe they're not it's not optimal for women to do it did I say all or did I say said none I literally just asked you can we replay replay it my exact words were this to you I said almost almost none is that all okay is almost none the word all no I'm pretty sure you said none Noe I said almost none and the reason I I never put anything in a monolith because dumb [ __ ] liberals will always do this if I get point to one and then they say they're hang on hang on then they say they're the ones who are good faith if I could point to one then you're all claim so I never make the all claim what I'm saying to you is that most almost all women almost all not all almost all are incapable of doing roof work incapable physically of doing it okay and this is where I disagree I now we can get to the argument okay I think we could say I at least to my understanding of a frof work I'm pretty sure most women could do it it's just not optimal it's not ideal it would probably be easier if a guy did it but that doesn't mean women are incapable of doing roof work or almost all women and women's body temperature regulate the same um no I think women run slightly colder they have trouble in in heat yeah but it doesn't mean that it's not possible for them to do roof work well wait not possible for most of them to work in extreme temperature conditions it's I'm sorry is it the same temperature all the time when it comes to your roof outside that makes it worse because of heat regulation so women have a harder time heating up and cooling down and so what happens is when you're doing something like roof workg for instance you'll have a black tar that's laid under you and so even if it's 70° outside it' be 110° on the roof it's 110° outside 140° on the the roof what happens is women actually physically cannot deal with the regulation of temperature and their because of their physiology their muscular skeletal system is so small what what ends up happening is they heat up even faster doing labor that men do which takes them half the energy so it takes more energy for a woman to pick something up than a man yeah as I said before it might not be optimal but that doesn't make it impossible so even using your same example of roof work what would end up happening is that instead of doing it like almost any time in the day or whatever if we lived in a society of only women for whatever hypothetical reason okay what would have to happen women would have to do it in different times it's not that it wouldn't do it yeah then show me a society where women ever [ __ ] built anything and ever ran the [ __ ] society and I don't want to hear some tribal Amazonian [ __ ] society that we look up and we find out that nope it's not some matriarchal society there has there is no Society ever ever in the history of any of of mankind you can point to where there was a matriarchal Workforce which took care of all of the infrastructure work for the society or even half or even 20% or even 10 or even 10% has there ever been like a male Society with no woman whatsoever no obviously not yeah well no wait we we can we can look let me explain let me explain yeah go explain so we have militaries right ancient militaries who often were off doing something for 6 seven years in a foreign Nation right with a mass unit and I'm talking thousands right sometimes tens of thousands 20s of thousands that's a massive Society in the ancient world all men right for years at a time yes we can point to societies of all men regulating themselves operating yes that is no because I here that society would not be able to sustain itself in the long term they did sustain themselves the long term no I guess we have different definitions long term because all I'm thinking about is that there's literally no children in an old male Society if you're talking cross generationally it would collap what I'm saying is that no Society can even do what those men did as soldiers for 10 or 12 years who are women they can't even do that it's not possible for them to even do it I don't know I think it's really interesting because when we look at parts of our history even within the United States when a [ __ ] ton of men like the population of men like decreased Prett yeah because they were all were War because they all basically went out it's not like things collapsed on themselves like things are because were still here running things yeah no but women could still and maybe we just fundamentally disagree here but women could still be in those positions of power and things would still work no they weren't in the position they could be I don't think that they could be so okay well here we have a fundamental disagreement and that's what we're debating so let's get into the debate when all the men went off to war and women went and worked in the factories they were putting screws in a [ __ ] pack they weren't designing the bombs they weren't designing the grenad do you think women aren't capable of Designing bombs or grenades I think that they have extreme trouble with physical engineering because of their physical strength yeah okay do you think that the mind like I I'm just really curious here okay um here do you think there's a oneon-one on physical strength and like your mental capabilities no of course not of course not right what would that have to do with anything okay that has to do with everything telling me a woman cannot design how a bomb would be because she's not physically strong enough there is obviously like a complete like collapse of reality I asked you is it possible for women to Des what was my answer you said because you're not strong enough it would be difficult I said with what field applied what you didn't say applied anything yes I said applied engineering was my exact words you're just not listening I am listening and I'm pretty sure we can go back on the I'll start right down you buy in andout for the entire studio if we back this up and I said in applied engineering okay let's do it let's do it where's Brian you want us back it up go say applied engineering specifically if I said if I said women have trouble and struggle and physically with applied engineering yep then you'll buy in and out for the whole studio go for it all right how long this was only rewind it to minute and half minute and a half I don't know I think it's really interesting because when we look at parts of our history even within the United States when a [ __ ] ton of men like the population of men like decreased Prett yeah because they were all at war war because they all basically went out it's not like things collap on themselves because were still here running things yeah no but women could still and maybe we just fundamentally disagree here but women could still be in those positions power and things would still work they weren't in the position they could be I don't think that they could be so okay well here we have a fundamental disagreement and that's what we're debating so let's get into the debate when all the men went off to war and women went and worked in the factories they were putting screws in a [ __ ] pack they weren't designing the bombs they weren't designing their grenades do you think women aren't capable of Designing bombs or grenades I think that they have extreme trouble with physical engineering because you did not say physical applied engineering you said applied there is a difference what physical is applied no okay you applied okay go get the [ __ ] Inn out you can't weasle your way out of this my way there's a very big him because he did not say physical applied engineering go back 30 second or go back 1 minute actually right now you want to go further back no no I want to go now further back cuz he said physical applied engineering and I said I said physical engineering no you said physical applied engineering and then you said oh I never said that listen you're right I said if I didn't say applied engineering physical engineering is applied engineering okay I you there's a very huh okay need to go back I just need the In-N-Out is what I need there's a very when you're not getting out of the in and out there's a very big difference between what is it me having to physically build a bomb yep versus me engineering a bomb for physical use can we agree with that yeah okay so you agree women are capable of like physically designing said is that women have trouble with physical engineering which is a lot of applied engineering yes okay I'm trying to counter phrase this putting your hand on your face doesn't make you a better debat I know I'm I'm frustrated Destin ISM you got to stop next you going to do the triangle do the triangle hands there you go yeah okay mhm um applied engineering or I want to even say physical applied engineering and maybe maybe I'm just wrong here maybe we can Google the definitions um there's a difference between design right and designing things for application and for use versus actually physically building those things yeah most engineering and maybe again maybe I'm wrong here I'm open to being wrong um is focused on design it's not focused on me actually building those things that's somebody else's job yeah that would be the person I'm talking about okay you see the person specifically talking about design design a house right yes but somebody has to build a house you're the designer going to build a house yeah okay so when I say that women have trouble with physical engineering what I'm saying is that when they have to actually apply past the this is in my mind and build the [ __ ] thing where you need the engineers to actually build it they have a big [ __ ] struggle with that okay but that's interesting because I asked you specifically do you think women are going to have trouble designing bombs and I said no I said but what they have trouble with is physical engineering yeah maybe my reality is being like lapsed or something with yours or something cuz I thought you specifically said yes they're going to have trouble with it they do have trouble because of the physical application but these are two separate things yes but what I'm saying to you is that listen if you have women who are just there in an engineering all the men are off at War okay this was the point of this all the men are off at War and a woman designs a phenomenal bomb like the bestest bomb ever doesn't matter if she can't [ __ ] build it or the other women around can't [ __ ] build it if it requires the Engineers that's the point okay here's another thing mhm it does require a level of strength to build things however we also and I this I'm saying Machinery as if it's like this really complicated thing but I'm talking about like simple like pulley or lever systems ever since like Humanity first could build things to get out of having to use their brute physical strength they have and this has come to the advantage of both men and women who are capable of doing this I'm not saying men and women are oneon-one when it comes to physical strength why then why haven't they been building [ __ ] forever I they have they have maybe not in the same way I'll tell you what name one single female invention um I'm trying to think what is it there's a specific tool in agriculture what's it called I can't let's Google it right now no no it's not can you just name it I know I am going to goog no no no name it you can't name a single one you got to Google it well what is it you're asking me about specifically you said women invent [ __ ] all the time what what are they inventing they literally specifically invented like a form of Agriculture that had to do with like what is it oh like rotational crop Fielding something like that like that's the exact terminology or something can you think of a tool um I don't think you can even bring back the like first tools to like man or woman like I don't think you have like the first like for the I can't think I don't think it's fair to say the first Speer was like built by a man or the first Hammer why not because we have no evidence of that we just have evidence of humans using tools we know we know who who brewed the first beers they were monks yeah we don't know yeah but we're talking about very basic tools we're talking about tools that either now now you're obsa again no I'm not your claim was since the beginning of time when we figured out the pulley and the lever system which I would say we probably had access to even from an evolutionary prism for like 50,000 years or more sure okay if that is the case this was not knowledge which was just limited to men okay so if that is the case where's all these women building all these [ __ ] societies knowing how to use that pulley and that lever system because Society well let's right here you do know that there are societies and that there were societies before by the way how can you be a buildings and have to Google a single female invention I have female accomplishments from top of my head but regardless of that separate from that okay um you do know there were societies that existed before the invention of like a concrete building right you do know this okay cool do you know what a nomadic Society is there were were wait they didn't have concrete buildings yeah cool so you know what ntic were debate over I concede you you know okay no I didn't know that now you didn't know ble my mind there was societies which existed without concrete building I know it's very hard to believe um so you you know about nomadic societies right yeah sure okay so you know for like tens of thousands if not a lot more years the way that humans lived for the the mass vast majority of societies humans lived in were nomadic societies right yes answer yes so wait a second we we're not sure here's why we do know that we had civilizations up to 10,000 years ago real civilizations that had governments and writing and sophisticated individuals who ran inside those civilizations So when you say most of these societies were pneumatic not sure because because we've lost tons and tons of information on even the societies which existed 10,000 years ago there could have been great societies which existed before that not sure about that okay not sure I'm willing to concede that most of them even up to 20,000 years ago were nomadic okay at least according to most like modern anthropologists and even those beforehand um what seems to be when you use that tone like this it actually doesn't help your case but it is annoying well I want to maybe annoy a little bit because it's my just my voice um it's the destiny tone but why do you all do that anyway why we look at the da and da da da da da da and da da right so when we look at most societies uh I'm just going to keep doing it because we keep calling out so it's harder to even like forget um basically throughout most human history we were nomadic creatures we would basically hunt and you know travel in groups essentially and then it usually became like once the agricultural or the first Agricultural Revolution came where we were like oh my God we could actually stay in this area we can actually grow things here we don't have to constantly move from one place to another place anal husbandry and all of this I don't know what this has to do with anything because you're saying oh why weren't women essentially building like these intense architect they had at least 10,000 years um 10,000 years recorded history the fact is we've had societies for you know tens of thousands of years that just weren't based on like having to have physical structure to function like that's just it like we like this came yeah but that would be for men and so what I'm saying is when we did which is at least 10,000 years at least 10,000 years we've had standing buildings with structures that had some kind of government in them this type of thing at least you would agree 4,000 years ago we had great structures cities Nations the whole nine yards up to 2,000 years ago which is a long [ __ ] time 2,000 years where's all these [ __ ] female inventions civilizations where where's where's all these great so answer contri where are they at oh my gosh okay what I want to say or what I want to explain m is that the ancient world stigmatized women well what happened was after the Agricultural Revolution what it seems to happen is that men got more control of the Agricultural Supply so they gained More Level and Power in society to Institute essentially societal rules so if you want to talk about like why women haven't women done this or why women haven't done that well how come they couldn't just use their big brains to stop that from happening um post Agricultural Revolution like yeah part of the reason is men did Institute these systems of power in place that benefited them um because they're much stronger than women oh yeah partially because of physical Force well wait what what no let's go for it let's go for it yes physical for because of physical Force cuz they're much stronger than women but that doesn't mean that Society was always predicated upon gr physical Force cuz as we've seen before we had is predicated on brute physical force force okay sure we could talk about that yeah let's talk about that so this is what we were leading into anyway I I need to clarify okay you're saying oh um you know this is just how it is this is just how it be and I'm trying to say no there were you know tens of thousands of years before modern day civilization where we still existed in a society without brute physical Force essentially nomadic societies nomadic societies use Brew physical force all the time okay nomadic societies as a whole um were not predicated on this idea of like oh no like men have all this 100% control over woman what it seemed to be is that we would Hunt and Gather at PS when you say seed I I need you to take a stronger position than seed see seemings seemings are frustrating to me because that's a I'm not really committing to this I'm just saying I think so maybe so with without using the word seam are you willing to commit to that position I'm willing to commit to the fact that the way that early um Human Society formed and was structured was basically around you know like nomatic principles of essentially always moving hunting in packs as groups together taking care of children together like basically wandering around the globe um in the pursuit of like you know yeah but civilization's predicated on Force you agree with that I yes I would say after yeah okay including this one we're talking about modern civilization yes yes okay well modern being whatever civilization whatever civilization reolution post cultural revolution yeah so that's all predicated on physical Force um somewhat but I'll say yes for now okay so men have the Monopoly on this force not anymore but they did how do we not have a monopoly on Force now what happened was essentially with the invention of modern Weaponry um which became like essentially like a great equalizer and not just modern Weaponry but also the ability I guess I guess we could say bombs are a type of modern Weaponry so you realize modern Weaponry still requires physical strength to use yeah I don't disagree with that but the point is um if I have a gun and you don't you're fxed yeah but what if you have a gun and I have a gun has the the problem is not everybody is strapped all the time it it does matter it does 100% it does I I can demonstrate this for you okay it does matter because if I had a gun in this room right now it would make me basically the Cesar of violence or whatever um if but you would be disadvantaged compared to men who had them um maybe well here's I can demonstrate this I know you're going to talk you're going to talk about um recoil and stuff like that nope I'm just going to talk about a basic statistic which okay so um women have their guns taken away from them in physical altercations where they're defending themselves at like 10 times the rate that men do okay I so which means that they 10 times the rate right but let's just say it's just double or let's just say it's just I don't know half again there's still at a disadvantage to men even when it comes to having weapons yeah there is so men still so even if you use the weapons as being a force multiplier men would still have the advantage there is a multitude of factors that are going into conflict that amount of firearms training that you do is twice as strong as you are Paladin donated $100 wow what a gross misunderstanding of history no concept at all of where our Foods come from try and go kill a cow with some stone tools princess how is that not Brute Force that's true well that's the part of the force predicate but we're getting to it if a woman who was not you but had the exact same amount of weapons training that you did was twice as strong as you would you have an advantage with weapons over you she had more training same but she was more strong than me she was just double your strength but had the same amount of weapons knowledge would she have an advantage faster than me she's just stronger I'm not sure would she have an advantage over you if she was armed and you were not versus you were armed and she was not she was armed I'm not yes if she's armed and you're not she would have an advantage over me and if you were armed and she was not right that well you would have the advantage from the gun right yes but she would have an advantage over you if you were unarmed right if I was unarmed yeah so think of it this way in this situation if you had a gun and she did not she would have more of an advantage than if she had a gun and you did not you see what I'm saying so it would still her chances of being able to disarm you would still be better than your chances of disarming her in the same situation yeah the question becomes essentially who shoots faster and more accurate if we well fast is a matter of strength as well guns require great hand strength you you don't believe me no it's not that I don't believe you I'll tell you what let's do this walk me through loading a semi-automatic handgun I'm not going to walk you through loading a semi-auto okay walk me through loading a revolver I'm not going to walk you through loading walk me through loading a revolver hang on hang on hang I'm not going to walk you through anything I will tell you is that we look at Olympic level I'm not done with the inquiry and then you can ask me can you walk me through loading a rfle I'm not going to talk to you about you ever even used a gun yes I've used a gun before um I've used a pistol and rifle before what kind I'm not I don't remember the exact kind but that's none of this questioning has to do with the basic of what we were trying to get here oh no I think that it gets right to the core principle of the force monopo what you're trying to do is that you're trying to essentially Flex I have more you know knowledge on specific Gunnery I don't care about that what I care about is Force Monopoly and your misunderstanding of it no because what I am trying to convey here is very simple when we look at even like Olympic style athletes Olympic Shooting MH um topof the top they're thinking about getting rid of individual gender categories because guess what men and women are shooting essentially almost exactly the same race that's because they're using 22s okay the point being yeah if they were using 50 caliber bmgs you would have gender categories I promise okay the point being is that when it comes to Weaponry when it comes to the great when it comes to the great force equalizer unless if we are living in a hypothetical world where everybody is strapped all the time which they are not the person usually even though there are Exceptions there are cases you can wrestle out the gun from the person's arm whatever like that does happen um the vast majority of time the person who has the gun is at a ridiculous advantage and who has all the guns um whoever like both men and women have guns right now who has the most overwhelming majority not even close yeah okay um who is it which one no you're going to be like oh you see men have a lot of guns so that's why this is your case for Force multiplication my case for for Force multiplication is one men can build guns women don't seem to be very competent at building guns we've had 3D tech for an awful long time to just build your own they don't do it I'm not they're incapable well when you say that right what's your demonstration that they are that most women are capable of even building their own gun I think because very simply put and we can we can Google the instructions of like how to build a gun um it's something that most people who have the knowledge and the schematics to do can do it's not something that is like oh no you have to be at least 6'5 to be able to build a gun like that's not the case why do you think it is that women don't really ever build them I think um women are usually trained from a young age to not really be into stuff that are violent I think that's generally the case well wait that's weird there's nations in which women have to do mandatory military service they're still not bu even in Nations that have mandatory military service there's still very specific roles that we generally push women and men to do so how do you think that right now in modern society that men don't have the Monopoly on Force how do women have any sort of comparable Monopoly on Force to men I I I got know not what is it the Monopoly of force even if you say like oh no men in general have more guns therefore they have more Monopoly on Force um well they have the Monopoly on force from physical strength yeah it's I think it's also like physical strength and the ability to produce things that are even make them even more powerful yeah I I think even the way that you're conceptualizing Monopoly of force is is I don't want to say gr gross misrepresentation but a little bit um here let's phrase it this way okay how do you think war or oh I think I know what I'm going to get to whatever okay you are equating the ability to use brute force to the ability of power or you're saying power essentially comes from the ability of being like physically physically powerful yeah no that's where we have a fundamentally disagreement Okay so so no so powerful people don't rely on enforcement powerful people don't just rely on Brute Force wa wait wait let me finish that wasn't what I said I know you said on enforcement mhm and what does enforcement rely on multiple different things one of them one of them I'll Grant you one of them is um physical LOL paladins donated $100 it's the same reason there are no women Navy Seals it's not because their co-workers will teas because we don't want women to be in the Navy terrorists and protecting their country it's not because pixie over here couldn't walk me through how to load a gun it's because the stigma against women in the Navy is preventing them from completing basic underwater demolition training let's focus all right I'm focusing um one of the ways to enforce power is through brute force that is one way no all power is going to have enforcement all yeah but there's different types of enforcement okay uh but all of it's going to reduce to Brute Force no I disagree okay give me a power Dynamic that's not going to reduce to Brute Force um let's say you have a person a guy who doesn't want to play Child Support or whatever um you can have the state throw him into physical jail whatever um or if he's you know doing his job he's going to work you couldn't have a social agreement with a job essentially to garnish your wages so that is an agreement that technically there's no physical Force involved you can just talk that's really weird what happens if the guy who's paying him says Ah I'm not going to do that yeah in a theoretical world that could resolve but not theal you're you're looking don't go let me finish answering the question you're missing the let me finish answering or asking the question then you can answer it what happens in your scenario this is your scenario guy a uh who is the payer right and he is paying x to the state says Ah you know I'm not going to give it to you you changed my scenario what happens to him you changed my scenario yeah well because you Chang myen something else wait the thing that makes your scenario work implicitly is force no yes no yes let me finish let me then why would anybody pay it because maybe you know we socially agree the payer is like wow I think it's really [ __ ] up that guy isn't paying um his child support you know I agree with you I'm going to garnish his Wages that's not he's not physically it's a social agreement so wait so wait wait a second I agree with you that two people can make an agreement external Force however any agreement that they make if there's a violation of it it's going to require Force no matter what right but we have clearly which means everything that is the Pinnacle of what you're talking about any of this social contract [ __ ] you're talking about physical contracts you're talking about any contract you're talking about if there's a violation of it you're resorting to force yeah but what the point that I'm trying to get across is that I literally I quite clearly listed an example where it is possible to enforce something without physical Force no the for physical force is implicit no there's no implicit thing the person doesn't have to garnish his wages the person can be like no you know what um take him to jail instead or whatever you could theoretically that would be Force yeah no but the point is again I think you're missing the forest I think you're missing the forest of the trees all of that requires Force no because the point is you could theoretically have an example where none of it required Force the person just had give me that example I literally just gave it to you and you're like no there's an implicit because because the example here of consent of wait a second we can make a a contract with each other and as La as we both follow the contract it's not even a contract it's just an agree it's remit a contract no but a contract basically predispose presupposes that there's going to be some level of um what is it terms essentially you get this I get this and if the terms get violated then you know then whatever happens there's for so the thing that gives that contract validity you can have an agreement with a person that you know you basically get you what you want without any implicit threat of course you could literally have Pagan donated $100 the point is that the and then police would have to support if refusal they're going to jail using Force yeah the problem I your argument I'll steal man the argument and instead of sping and screaming just like listen to what I'm saying I love sping I know and screaming but instead of screaming like don't be the screeching feminist for a second I love screeching okay stop the yeah to Steel to Steel man lol paladins donated $100 perfect example she can agree to buy you in and out by making a Bad Bet contract true but without Force she isn't ever going to actually think I don't think she's going the problem with bad contracts without without Force right so the thing is is I'm going to agree to this principle the agreement of the principle is that if I agree or enter into an agreement with you of any kind any kind and I hold up my end of the agreement you hold up your end of the agreement we can have something where there's no Force but what I am going to say is that there's an implicit underlying kind of thing here which is saying if you don't agree because otherwise why would we need agreements or if you change the agreement there's going to be some kind of repercussion otherwise why would you even need an agreement in the first place so if I say to you okay we're going to take this guy's [ __ ] money I agree with you uh I'm going to garnish his wage I'm going to give it to you great you're right there's no Force at all that's applied there but there is the threat implicitly of Force if I suddenly say ah I changed my [ __ ] mind right now it's okay now there's going to be repercussion so I still think that that's forced Doctrine I'm not I'm not sure you've given me an example where it's not forced Doctrine think do you think we can have let's say in this theoretical Society or whatever um you as an employer mhm have either the right to agree with me or you can say oh no you know what you're going to have to take it up with him instead or individually through the state whatever ever um as an employer I'm going to choose to step away from this and not you know touch his wages or whatever MH um such a society could exist right where an employer opts to not deal with a state in a or not yeah to basically oh when it comes to like garnishing their wages you know what um instead of me doing it instead of me doing go to the bank instead that's you're you you the first route would be yeah I guess I guess the guy could could exit himself from this entire situation sure yeah okay so in such a society where that is an option there is no implicit threat of force for you not agreeing with me or yeah for you deciding to not gr because no there hasn't been any agreement yeah no but you could say hey so yeah I guess in a you could pull in a society where you make no agreements well no that's that's literally not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that you could easily have a society where you know you just agree with me you're like yeah that guy [ __ ] sucks I'm going to garnish his wages don't worry about it um no that society would still need Force yeah I'm not saying this I'm giving you an example I'm giving you a specific ex I know but even in this specific example it sure seems like the implicit threat of force well no I'm telling you I'm telling you literally hey you know what like you we can basically Institute this rule without any force and then if you decide to step away from it I'm not going to put a gun in your head and say no you have to garnish your wages I have to go to the bank instead and do an agreement with that and maybe that might involve Force but the point that I'm trying to get across is this is one example where we were able to Institute a change without any force or implicit threat of force because you don't have to say yes to me in order for you to be capable of having a society which even exists where it you're allowed to have an agreement with somebody that they can back out of and then you have to go external you would have to have Protectors of that Society right oh yeah sure and would that would those protectors be like armed military guys with vests and [ __ ] helmets and tanks and bombs police force yeah would you have to have an enforcement arm that wasn't the original like question essentially no the original thing was is that Society has uh all societies operate off of force Doctrine and men have the Monopoly on force and all you've done is demonstrate that that's true the argument that you were originally presupposing or supposing whatever was that it is not possible to basically exert power without physical force and I gave you an example clear example that's not exerting power no yes it is getting a person's w w is garnished there an implicit threat of force there no but I literally gave you an example where you were not threatened by force to their how could you for instance How Could You Lead a community an entire community of hundreds of people absent of force Doctrine how could that even be done that's not what is it that was not the original well that's power that's exercising power okay that's not what we were originally talk well that's basically you're extrapolating to a larger example because you can't contend with the fact that I did give you an example where no physical Force had to be involved to execute power it was implicit in the contract itself we literally disagreed that the person was not implicitly threatening that they could say I don't want to and have to go to somewhere else okay person B can back out of this entire Arrangement use no Force yes don't disagree however that still leaves with person a who wants the child support person C who doesn't and that might involve stop I'm stop so person a still exists he still wants support still wants to get it from personal C we still have force all you've done is say if you back away from a making an agreement of any kind socially with anybody you don't have to worry about Force Doctrine okay so what that's not an exercise of power in fact the power Dynamic here is the collector he's the guy who has the power the guy he's trying to collect from does not have the power so guy a still has still has the power and is still exercising Force what first of all and now the example that you just gave me of guy a garnishing the wages therefore he has a power that's also an example where it's not physical Force where he's using money back with physical Force he's using essentially money to or like the ability to like give money to leverage his power which is another example of power not necessarily needing physical Force okay listen let's go through this scenario again guy a he's our collector right guy a is collector guy B is our middleman you agree right our middle guy he's the guy you're collecting from and then guy C he is our uh agent we're taking from okay so we'll call him well we won't call him agent we'll call him victim okay so he's our victim okay so our collector goes to our middleman and says I want C's money okay and B agrees he's like great I'll give you C's money I don't give a [ __ ] right now we've entered into an agreement now guy B says okay I don't want to do this anymore you're saying that under the laws of the land guy B can back out of that guy a can give him no repercussions for doing that however guy B was never the guy who had the power here to begin with he did he guy a was the guy who was collecting from guy B guy B only had the power to ever walk away from the arrangement but had no power over the arrangement itself guy a is still in power still has force can still go after guy C wait that doesn't make any sense guy that's the only thing that makes sense no guy B obviously still has power CU he obviously could garnish the wages he obviously has the ability to monit control someone a here pass me the thing AB absent guy a guy B is not garnishing [ __ ] right oh okay I don't see that guy a guy a is absent guy a guy B isn't garnishing anything right okay you're saying collector middleman and then our victim and the middleman is the one who can garnish no no no guy a is asking middleman to garnish and you're saying the middleman doesn't really have any power right because the collector who's approaching him he has the power in the situation because he's saying even if you move away from this I can still just directly go after guy C guy B just because he agrees to work with gy doesn't actually have the power in this situation fundamentally disagree here because what yeah no we do on what cuz the middleman has the ability to garnish or not garnish wages that is a form of power being able to execute Financial control over someone is a form of power without Force this is the opposite guy B if he disagrees what happens to him nothing happens as we've established here and so then guy a just bypasses him and goes for guys right yeah finds a different way to go so how did Guy B ever have power here because Guy B can decide whether to garnish the wages or Not by the way if you were let me ask you this if you're guy a right and Guy B can tell you no and you can just directly go after guy C why would you use guy B Because as we've stated before there's forms of executing power that don't include Brute Force so Brute Force might be the last option it might be not the most reliable option um you know there's a chance that other guy might fight back that's why we have so many forms of power in our society that don't rely on on what I can't really think of money money is the biggest one money is the biggest reinforcer money is the one that is like most easy to control and manipulate other people with so utilizing incentives right I agree that you can accumulate some kind of power which is then going to have to be have some kind of enforcement arm to keep no matter what there's no power Dynamic I can think of that's not going to require some kind of force or enforcement even you getting divorced is going to require enforcement even you having child custody is going to require enforcement you driving down the street requires enforcement you sleeping at night requires enforcement everything you do has an enforcement arm behind it yeah I think what we or maybe our major disagreement or I'm not even sure anymore but basically there are forms of executing power that don't rely on Brute Force now if you don't get what you want now if you don't get what you want you might eventually end up doing Brute Force but there are still ways of controlling other people that don't involve a gun to your head I'm not saying that you can't make incentive programs or agreements which people can follow or that people will volunteer for what I'm saying is that there's no power Dynamic that I'm aware of where force is not implicit if the contract is broken or I can't use money or I can't get you to agree then we use Force otherwise we would have no criminal element we just bribe him out of being criminals right and he can't do that you can't bribe everybody out of being criminals you got to still no matter what even in your communist socialist Utopia where uh everybody's singing [ __ ] Kumbaya and they're all you know playing guitars around trees there's going to be some [ __ ] element there which is going to require enforcement no matter what yeah I think um and who are those people going to be do you think for the most part men or women executing that enforcement yeah it's basically the people who hold Weaponry so if the vast majority yeah no oh it's people hold Weaponry yes it is because as we've stated before um for the vast majority of cases even though yes women might be more likely to get wrestled out it doesn't matter cuz the vast majority of cases the person who holds a weapon is a person with Advantage so let me ask you a question let's assume for a second that you were in charge of a prison right each one of your prison guards they have a weapon right in this case a [ __ ] club and some of them who sit up in the guard towers they have rifles that that's true okay and what their job is is to make sure that this collection of really really strong [ __ ] men who are in there for a variety of very violent crimes uh they were kept under control and guarded day and night you could choose the most qualified uh security team possible for this the women are just as trained as the men as prison guards right they have the exact same amount of training the same skill set would you go with all women or all men this is okay obviously this is okay is not an argument no no this is no to me this is just uh what is it the deflection or I'm not sure if deflection is the right word the point is as we've stated before when it comes to brute physical strength or even weapons that matter let me let me finish even weapons that do include greater amount of strength they're not great yeah but no there's a huge difference between me having to sway around like a javelin or something let's use something like that as an example versus me but it still just requires a level of strength but being able to shoot somebody from across the room oh really so you don't have to carry ammunition magazines tactical vests uh sidearm helmets you don't have to carry hundreds of pounds of equipment with you while you're using these these point when go through you the CH that's not the point oh yes it is a point because the CH the vast majority of people once that bullet [ __ ] goes through you you're going to be down the point here is who's going to be down for the which sex is more capable of the of handling these weapons and so thus we'll always have Monopoly even with weapons when it comes to Weaponry itself a prison let me finish my turn inside of a prison for instance you have guards who hold mini4 okay Min 14s do require some strength to wield accurately and you're going to be loading up [ __ ] magazines takes a lot of hand strength UL is the Pagan donated $100 see is hung up on enforcement doesn't mean exclusively physcal Force if you get a speeding ticket the courts have the enforcement power to compel to pay refusal then beings involuntary compli that is physical Force so actually that is a physical Force example if you refuse to pay we're going to use physical Force to make you pay see but here what I'm talking about inside of a prison you think that guns themselves are just up I have this light weight little tiny gun well then what are you trying to say no what I'm trying to say is that for the vast majority of people um if a person is weaponless and another person has a gun specifically a gun the person who does not have anything is at a disadvantage yes but I don't I don't even disagree that that's $100 sorry in advance but all women understand this I'm a big strong man I want pixie the only thing keeping you safe from me is force right sleep comfortably tonight because force is protecting you from me okay yeah so so here's the thing I'm going to I'm going to give you these two scenarios to try to take this to its logical conclusion as fast as we can all the gun distribution in the United States write this second overnight okay disappear from the hands of men and are redistri redistributed to all women in the United States they now have every gun inside of the United States that's what they have the men have zero guns they have none not a single one okay and the women collectively decide we're going to enslave men okay that's what they decide they have all the guns they should be able to enslave all the men right um no I don't think so I think um what I don't think it's the other way around either I think there's a reason triangle I'm doing the triangle there's a reason why even um what most yeah there's a reason why even most patriarch patriarchal societies fall down even if men do have the Monopoly of violence in those areas as well and the reason why is because the way that Warfare what patriarchies are falling down they're doing fine um I don't well do you think the United States is the same patriarchy it was a 100 years ago it's never been it was a Republic from the gate okay do you think a patriarchy and Republic are fundamentally opposing I thought they can be yeah but what I'm saying is that this this wasn't set up as a traditional patriarchy this was set up as a weird kind of bizarre Protestant Enlightenment experiment yeah has a patriarchy ever fallen down before uh well yeah but there's only ever been patri there's never been real matriarchies no I'm not saying it has to be matriarchy then I'm just saying it's like mean if the pool is 100% and some of them fall off I don't I don't even know I'm saying it goes from a fullon patriarchy to basically a much more egalitarian society compared to before I don't know that you can even avoid patriarchy I have fundamental disagreements that a that a society can even exist really absent a patriarchy but let's get back to this sorry can I'm I'm not going to let you deflect why is it that the collective of all women inside the United States if they had firearms and decided to enslave men why is it that they couldn't I don't think either way maybe temporarily uh but I think I me definitely men could do it no I think what it again I can get your societies right now where they've done it yeah no let me please let me finish okay I think it would be possible temporarily to enslave maybe the other half of the population but the way that most Warfare works out is not even Brute Force brute strength there's I'm going to give you an example okay um the United states in the 60s against Viet Kong the average American was a lot better nutrition um stronger even the scrawnier ones whatever than the average vet Kong person that is incorrect I do not believe that's incorrect not only is up right now well yet go ahead here so the Viet Kong operated on a fish rice diet they were extremely strong they were very lie and they were able to operate for way longer periods of time absent food than the American Soldier was they were not weaklings by any I'm not saying that they were weaklings I didn't say they were weaklings I'm saying that yeah it did not seem like the nutritional standard was necessarily the same it was better I don't know about that rice and fish can you guys goog are you serious rice and fish that's like the staple for how these people live to 120 years old regardless we could use another example okay we could say the average um American Soldier versus the British army that's another example um you mean when in the 1800s like the when we were or sorry before 1800s you mean in the 1700s or the revolution 1700s the British were way way better uh they had way better nutrition men couldn't men couldn't cook yeah and we still somehow won why because of the French yeah yeah okay yeah not just had nothing to do with it no not just that not just that but also because of the war Warfare that we were doing specifically and we could not just like basically we lost every major battle in the war almost the only reason we ended up winning is because the British were [ __ ] sick of sending troops all the way to [ __ ] North America that was it it was a if there wasn't a vast ocean there wouldn't be a this would be a British colony wait is that I'm pretty sure there were various battles United States won um significance battles regardless but I'm saying that almost in almost every engagement let me finish let me finish but in almost every engagement the British soldier was better trained better equipped better outfitted had better nutrition and they won the vast majority of the conflicts yeah I don't I'm not 100% sure if that's true it's true um I also don't think they won basically they couldn't get two shots out of the [ __ ] mil let me finish they couldn't get two shots out of the militia to my understanding or I remember from reading in history the way that Warfare was carried out between the British and Americas were something that they were not necessarily used to because um the American people at the time used what we would essentially modern day called like Guerilla Warfare tactics that was no gorilla Warfare is known for being super freaking effective it was not during that time period here's why I'll explain to you why can I can I just finish talking about gorilla Warfare for one second uhhuh even though in this particular case you brought up it's not really a very good example but I'm not oh the Native Americans were great at gorilla Warfare too what happened to them yeah no but it seems like in a lot of Native Americans died because of straight up disease more than anything else true I agree um it seems that when it comes to I don't know about that seems can we make a committed statement yes Guerilla Warfare tactics are highly effective especially against traditional militaries for a variety of reasons the point that I'm trying to get at is that Modern Warfare is not even 100% like brute physical strength even machine strength not necessarily um which I'm sure that we could agree that the Americans at least in terms of like Machinery were much better um equipped than the Viet Kong nope okay they were they were better they were better equipped in some ways for they had helicopter tactics but they also had agent orange they had they also had M16 a1s that these were invented by Eugene Stoner and they didn't [ __ ] work and the Viet Kong and the Vietnamese running around with sks's and AK-47s had an advantage for two years of the war because of that so no our Weaponry was subpar uh going into the war from an infantry standard we went from Thompson's to M16s terrible idea by Robert mcnamer that you don't even know what I'm talking about but but but here's the thing no let you nothing you're going to listen for a second I am listening you're just trying to I'm trying to explain to you what this you brought this up no but yeah you're not letting me finish my freaking sentence I was going to say okay well when you're done then say I'm done and then when I say two words don't cut me off okay go ahead the point that I'm trying to get across is that in it seems a lot of Guerilla Warfare tactics especially when it comes to like let's modern day fighting whatever whatever are highly effective and the reason for that being is that the way that Warfare seems to work or it seems to work a lot of times is that hey if you are able to catch your enemy by surprise if you're able to use subverted me like subverted measures if you're able to basically yeah catch them off guard there is a tactical advantage to that so when you're talking about a society that's like oh let's say all the men now suddenly have the guns are they going to be like able to enslave women for eternity the answer is not necessarily because there are subverting me methods of fighting back that do make it impossible for I think any one gender to have a long-term forever forever for you know 100% in the future complete control okay then we'll limit it even we'll limit it do you think that if the the United States all of the guns went over to the women okay and none of them no men now had guns none okay these are just gone they wake up their Tire CL all the magic LOL paladins donated $100 I won't let you B merch the good name of Eugene Stoner absolutely nothing wrong with his rifle design the for p rining if you must much like women lubrication is key Noe that's not true low paladins they had the wrong ammunition for the gun and it was there's a whole whole tale of it you should you should read Robert Mam's Memoirs on it he really [ __ ] things up when it came to the distribution of the M16 but that that aside does doesn't matter back to this the question is all women wake up they have all the Arsenal of all of the men in the United States they're not looking to enslave them they're going to take them all out that's what they're going to do they're going to take them all out versus the opposition of men collectively wake up one day in the United States and they're going to take out all the women do you think that women would be able to accomplish this I don't think either yeah no they wouldn't I think that men could accomplish it I don't think men could accomplish okay so tell me what the would be if men collectively woke up tomorrow with the weapons that they have available to them right now and decided to wipe every woman off the face of the United States what would actually be the barrier there I think what would end up happening go like God forbid this is such a bleak scenario um you'd probably end up having a [ __ ] ton of women doing or men whatever whichever one you want to do essentially like using Gorilla Warfare tactics to fight against us other half so whether that means making like homemade bombs whether that means I'm not joking the [ __ ] Molotov cocktail like what do you you don't have to laugh at me I'm you think that women are going to be making pipe boms in their kitchen while men are go walking around taking them all out no I I think yeah I think if we're going to if we're going to create an absurd scenario where half of the population wants to actively kill the other population with guns yeah I think people are going to take Extreme Measures wherever they can to protect themselves and to fight against the other house do you think that if men collectively had that will to do that right that's all they wanted to do was just take out the other sex right would they accomplish that feat or do you think that women would have a good Fighting Chance I don't know about what a good fighting chance but I think that there is going to be a percentage well I don't think it's going to be ever possible to completely Holocaust other gender just because in terms of numers don't use that word you know you know better than that on you no I I mean you would be purposely eliminating yeah I know but don't use the word just don't use the word use any other word but that word was it cuz of T so sorry yeah yeah so anyway so I understand they want to uh g-word the other the other sex I understand that you don't think that that's possible but please engage with it yeah yeah I'm even engaging hypothetically I'm saying like even in these hypotheticals um I still think because of the number amount of women and men there are um LOL paladins donated $100 I know it's exactly what did happen in Afghanistan as soon the US left away their rights there's nothing they Islam is right about women joking maybe that's absolutely what happened whenever men have collectively decided to take away women's rights they don't have rights anymore that's it and there hang on hang on before you make the it's be but long term there could be social revolutions I'm going to go ahead and agree there could be social revolutions where you change men's mind that's why I'm asking specifically about intent men's Minds in this scenario can't be changed they have decided you need to be a second class citizen forever and that's all they're ever going to think forever more what could women physically do about that so what I wanted to bring up or what I'm going to bring up is that now these scenarios have fundamentally changed there's a difference between I'm going to try to g-word an entire population and I want them under my subservience either way if yeah no there there's fundamental differences here then engage with both it's going to be the same answer either way no because the fundamental difference here is that when it comes to the second one mhm you are forcibly trying to keep women alive to have them be the second class citizens yeah that is the scenario where you end up with basically women potentially not always but um poisoning the [ __ ] out of men essentially or finding subservient measures um not sub basic yeah sub oh no not a couple of poisoned men not just a couple I mean there's a reason why um it's hard to figure out the amount of women who are serial killers and when we even find them the number is like extremely high it's hard to find out the number of men too well it's a lot easier because men tend to use I guess like The Brute Force tactics versus poisoning s to we don't know how many men utilize poisoning just like with women we don't know that's fair but the point is that when it comes to basically being subversive trying to fight against um systems of Oppression it doesn't always have to be done in terms of Brute Force there are other measures that people can take for example poisoning which is be very effective and can go a long time without being traced to help overtake status quo or even more explicit methods but the point is they're not up to your face like Guerilla Warfare um so if if the GW if men decided to GW all women tomorrow what do and and they have the Monopoly on Force just in current state okay I would actually like to know if General Daisy like John Connor From the Ashes Rose is like a [ __ ] Terminator right a Terminator destroyer and she's like I'm going to lead you to victory I'm going to teach you how to smash those metal [ __ ] into junk right General Daisy is the leader of the female Army who's going to stop these [ __ ] men from G wordingham what would General Daisy do yeah I to be clear I don't think in such a society women will be able to overtake and put the status quo back in order I think they would have to live basically the rest of their lives essentially like in hiding um now let's reverse the role yeah I think the same be said with men yeah you think that I so here's what I would say I would say that if all of the weapons all of the weapons including the nukes were handed over to women tomorrow collectively inside the United States and we had no access to any of that that immediately and women said we're taking all the men out I think we would win in 3 days yeah I think that's delusional yeah okay well let me let me tell you what I would base this on okay so day one I think that men would grab chair legs and bars and things like this and uh they would literally just run straight Force at a few women beat the tar out of them take their guns and then they would just continue the slew and I don't think women could do much about it I don't think if women were even going house to house they could do much about it and here's why I think that because I've seen trained officer after trained officer right try to subdue even with lethal force with Firearms men and watch them fail time and time and time again against just average guys they're not going up against UFC fighters they're going up against fat old dudes like me losing time and time again how is it possible that these highly trained women who have been learning uh um all sorts of self-defense subd tactics all of this are losing to just randos no training no nothing it's the Brute Force category right I think there's definitely cases where you know women lose control like we stated before I think um there's also probably a vast more majority of cases where women are just either shooting or in Capac incapacitating the guy or killing him so just because there's some examples of women losing control does it mean again as we've stated before the vast majority the vast majority of female officers have a hard time sing male suspects it's not that they the point is the vast majority of women with a gun even with like a male suspect or whatever if they use the gun the male suspect is going to be hurt even in the cases where they're in for the purpose of lethal Force they still often get subdued and have their firearms taken away from them what is uh exact percentage cuz last time you said or maybe I misunderstood what I can pull up the exact percentages but let's let's let us be highly charitable highly charitable and just say it's a lot more a lot more could be 10% let's say it's probably way higher than that I don't know off top of my head but you would at least agree it's got to be at least 10% um just for the sake of this argument let's say 10% yeah it's at least 10% of them uh more than the men who get subdued that's enough of an advantage I mean that's really all you would is 10% yeah I also now let's let's apply that also to the fact that most women like you couldn't tell me the process to even load a firearm so even if their Collective will Collective will was all to take out the men I don't think most of these women could even use the guns that magically appeared for him I think um What would most likely happen is that if women collectively decided to want to get rid of men this is so dark I'm like I kind of don't whatever um they would probably wait until men are most vulnerable a week which would probably ideally be while they were sleeping um and I think they'd still lose yeah I don't think they'd still lose but this is my point right is that even if we take what you're saying at face value and that women could put up some kind of resistance you have to agree that men overwhelmingly in this scenario would have a massive advantage in comparison to women in that scenario if that is the case then you are agreeing that when it comes to force Doctrine men are always going to be superior at it than women the next thing that we just need to agree to follow from that what no it doesn't follow what you're saying that just because oh they might have a slight Advantage at defending themselves that means now men always have the advantage um when it comes to force Doctrine they always have the advantage when it comes to force Doctrine they're stronger that's all you need no no no but you're saying in terms of if I'm talking about like again pure physical strength sure but we're talking about using like great equalizers yes even great equalizers we have a massive did you see what happened with Trump when the assassination did you see what the women did with their Cuts you're trying to use like emotional appeal um to okay but let's focus let's focus okay let's focus okay literally even if there are is a slight advantage to be able to defend yourself if you're a man whatever the point is for the vast majority of cases the person with the gun wins just because you are a like 10% whatever more likely to defend yourself doesn't change the fact that 9 out of 10 times you're [ __ ] okay backing up you do agree with me that you have to at least know how to use a firearm sure but people have I mean what is it you Pro probably will injure yourself if you don't do it correctly but yeah like people and you agree that ammunition weighs a certain amount yeah and you agree that guns weigh a certain amount yeah sure and you agree that you have disagree with any some kind of equipment that you carry with you yeah but the point being is that even with all of that um you know this isn't like a John Wick movie Whatever most people when they shot they're down so even with all those additional stuff you have to be able you have to be capable you have to be capable so guns can only work one dimensionally you have to be able to point it at the Target and be competent enough with it to actually hit the target which not as easy to do as you think by the way then the question becomes does physical strength give you a massive advantage in that category the answer is overwhelmingly yes it does and the thing is the proofs of this are innumerable not just the military let's take a look at the military training standards they have to consistently be lowered for women for everything from Sharp Shooting to accuracy to just basic infantry standards there's again still a vast difference even with all of that into account with a person who's armed and a person who's not armed at the end of the day obviously it's very different if we're equally armed but if we're not equally armed and the other person is not armed yeah like even in the cases where you might wrestle it out in time or whatever the vast majority of time the person with the gun just wins so in this case when you when you're saying Force Doctrine you're saying that as long as women are armed sufficiently they can have the Monopoly on Force I'm saying the Monopoly on Force doesn't rely on man or woman as much as it relies on who has Weaponry then why is it that all of the Force jobs which exist are overwhelmingly men yeah we go back to a variety of different factors one of them you know men might be just more inclined or wanting to do those jobs the other one being oh you know some level of discrimination the other one being um you know yeah I guess those would be the two biggest on you know I could take that stigma argument and I would even agree with it except for this why do they have to keep lowering the standards in law enforcement for women and in the military for women for physical Readiness why do they have to lower the standard across the board in prisons for female Readiness why do they have to keep lowering the standards lower standard because they can't get enough women to qualify for the regular standards that men have to adhere to if it is just a matter of stigma yeah and what I was trying to say before is that just because an institution tries to lower the whatever the requirements is trying to make it easier for women to be there doesn't necessarily mean the stigma is erased right stigma does not just come from an institution's rules stigma usually comes from the overlying societal that would be proof that women could not adhere to the same standards as men when it came to physical Readiness no basically or let me phrase it this way if I um let's say we have a pool of women right and let's say only a minority minority women let's say only um 20% of women are capable of meeting those standards women um Within These 20% um chances are 18% won't even apply um and 2% will apply and maybe from the other people who won't even make it the other 80% let's say 5% apply mhm okay now you have more women who are applying but they can't meet the standards very few who apply and can meet the standards but the vast majority of women from both of these camps are just not applying at all because hey like their family is not very into it they're more like scared for them or their family's more like no you should focus more on child rearing or doing this other thing it would look better for you like we would be happier if you did that that's where you get like screwy numbers essentially I do agree the V the lowering of the stand okay no I'm saying societal pressure exists outside let me ask you this let me ask you this question um if there's a fire in your apartment would you prefer that a 220 lb male firefighter came in so I'm not disagreeing men are generally stronger hang on or would you prefer that a 220 lb woman came in oh um to my understanding um even with the same weight it seems like men might have um like what is it muscular Advantage huge Advantage right so you still prefer that it was the man sure and would you prefer that the people who guarded you while you were asleep by that same logic were men or women yeah if we're talking about brute force and if you're saying that you're military is the people who are guarding you while you're sleeping you would prefer them to be men then yes um guarding yeah generally speaking we're talking about Brute Force so then you're saying that even in your preferences you prefer that men have the Monopoly on Force to even protect you in the first place what I'm saying is that if it comes to Brute Force obviously I would take the person who's stronger so almost not on average on overwhelming average okay but the point that I'm trying to explain here I don't want you to like underplay it and say ah it's 51% to 49 the point that I'm trying to explain here is that if I had to pick between like a 220 lb man and like a five5 woman with a gun I'd pick the five5 woman with a gun uhhuh but but if you could pick between the five5 woman with a gun or 55 uh 5 foot5 man with a gun which would you pick yeah sure I'll put pick the guy with the gun well actually I have one more question saying that they're both exactly equal right not one is cuz if the wom that they have equal training only okay I'm not ruling out their physiology that would defeat the purpose of the hypothetical okay cuz this is another and I mean there's like a bunch of like different studies here and I know you said oh it's because they're using the same type of rifle which I'm assuming they're using the same type here cuz then what is it that's where things get more complic ated because it becomes a question of who's a more accurate and faster shooter essentially cuz that's who's going to win so you would prefer the woman if she's a more accurate and faster shooter okay so uh just just so that we have the the man would still be stronger you agree with that sure the man is stronger but the woman's more accurate and faster so you would still go with the woman bia's man slave donated $100 fixie name two philosophers not named NS Dera Simone Fuko Marx sat Engles that your free education grant asked you read that you chose to read yourself Hess isn't an answer do you have a quick response to the uh TTS um I can't read all the names that he described but from the top of my head I'm thinking um Mills I'm thinking um I don't know if you mentioned that you could even go ancient Socrates Aristotle if you want um of course you went for the utilitarian first yeah that's one quick thing uh Andrew you posed a question to pixie that I don't think received a response and an answer the question was it was a jail scenario uh I believe where you if it could be all men or all women correction officers I don't think we got response on that oh yeah well if you're in a jail and right like I would not say batons are the same equalizer as a gun is and you don't have to use batons you can have guns no no no that so the question was if you could have an all female or an all male correction staff which would you pick and I think it was same exact training same training same weapons same weapons they could be guns if you had to pick one which would you pick there's plenty of Prisons that use guns as and and they don't even use batons hardly they use guns are they the same level of again this all goes back to me random they're they're just random correction officers who have the same exact training same exact training with Weaponry same exact training for control it okay okay just because you have the same exact training doesn't necessarily mean that you're same levels or maybe I'm here you could quantify for this for me or whatever accuracy and speed those are my number one concerns I'm going to even Grant this and say that the women inside of this Correctional Facility with their firearms are more accurate than the men and slightly faster in the deployment of those Firearms you would pick the women yes and if they if the guys were more accurate and faster cuz here's a deal you can't you could try try but if you're going to go after someone and try to take their gun and they're a faster and more accurate shooter good [ __ ] luck you know like again just like how this is in a John Wick movie the vast vast vast vast majority of people once you shoot them are [ __ ] down that's just it mhm so I would that my number one concern is accur now now let me ask you this this counter yeah the prison the the prison inmates are very upset about the fact that there's a bunch of armed [ __ ] running around this prison and they're like yeah you know they're uh they are more accurate than the men right I don't know to what degree but let's just say twice as accurate and they're slightly faster than the men and so the prisoners go yeah but we don't [ __ ] care CU they're a bunch of women and we're way stronger than them would it be easier for them to overpower those women you think than the men well the reason why keep saying accuracy and speed is so important is because yeah they could try well I mean how ACC do you need to be point blank with a gun not very accurate right yeah but if they're basically my concern about speed is just like mhm yeah good luck wrestling the gun away if the person is just kills you and you think even in that scenario that women would have the advantage over less uh accurate and less fast Shooters than women would inside of a prison environment yes I think the number one when it comes to guns if you're accurate fast enough nobody's gonna be and how how much easier would it be for um for men then to overpower those women yeah I think it would be substantially harder cuz they would just die because they're just so quick right yeah cuz they yeah even though they're only slightly faster than the M you said what is it or did you say they're more way more accurate but they're only slightly quicker okay but even if we doubled their speed do you realize do you realize um when you quantify this that what you're talking about is reloading a magazine uh from 3 seconds to 6 seconds that's speed right that's speed when you're talking about accuracy you're talking about the difference between hitting here and hitting there which who C who gives a [ __ ] who cares if I hit your button or I hit you in the neck it doesn't matter it's irrelevant the men are clearly going to have an advantage over the women in every aspect of this scenario whether you give them melee weapons you give them normal guns it wouldn't matter if they were less trained than the women just the physical strength component of it alone is going to give them an advantage over women it's again you can be a 66 buff beef cake whatever if I have a gun and I shoot you before you can reach me you're going to go down you know you do realize that men are less likely to go down uh than women are especially if you shoot even if you're shooting them Center Mass the vast majority of people you don't need the vast Ma you only need a few Okay the reason why I say the vast majority is because I'm saying like on average even a guy like that um most people on average are not going to be able to withstand a gunshot and keep going it's not the John Wick movie now let me ask you this you can invest in two prisons you can invest in two okay prison one they're going to hire female security or female you know uh prison guards those female prison guards are going to fit this criteria yes they're going to be far less strong than their male counterparts okay but they have been tested on the Range and on the Range we have determined they do reload quicker and they are more accurate with shot placement than the men and we're going to give them all guns they're going to guard the facility right all females another one it's all males who have slightly lesser standards like I said or even significant they're way less accurate when they're aiming here they hit you there instead and instead of a a six-second Reload you know what I mean they have a a 12C reload speed okay you can invest your life savings but only in these two options would you invest it in the female prison or the male prison one more question I'm sorry I'm being so specific about this it just go ahead um in the earlier one you said oh they're less likely to respect the women um so they're more likely to revolt is this a case here too well no I'm only giving you these qualifiers okay and the qualifiers are they fit it fits your criteria the all female guards who are going to be guarding the most horrific rapist murderers and lunatics uh that you can think of but they're all going to be armed and it's going to be the same exact Weaponry that the men have an counter prison in this hypothetical in this case the women do reload swiftly right they can pull the trigger even faster than the men can and their shot placements are above par of that of the their male counterparts I'll go with a woman I'm always going to put you would invest your money in the female prison yes I'm going to put my money where whoever is more accurate and faster cuz Good Luck Good Luck being as buff as you want if I get to shoot you twice or even once in most cases um before you get at me you know now do you agree that women um for these jobs you you mentioned stigma for a job like a prison inmate would you agree that female prison guards for the same work probably make a slightly lesser wage um probably I don't know yeah probably so then how come somebody doesn't just make an all female prison with these categories where they could pay these women way less wage well I think um what we were probably describing before um I think maybe I'm wrong but to my understanding like they usually don't want people to result into lethal Force right we were talking about like in the examples you gave me at least my understand what do you mean there's prison all over the world where they only use guns I thought we were talking about the United but even yeah I thought we in the United States maximum security prisons where there's guys on the walls with guns yeah okay let me phrase it this way mhm when you gave me the original scenario what I'm thinking is okay like the inmates are trying to escape whatever whatever yeah they would be trying to escape in these scenarios too sure yeah mhm okay um in real life usually you well first of all usually I would say probably more men are applying um I don't think women are very interested in being female guards sure they're not interested that's why they're selecting they're selecting from this group right yeah yeah I'm saying like you're asking me why don't why doesn't this play out in real life and I'm saying like Okay well in real life here's a couple of things there's not that many women interested B man slave donated $100 answer what is an R have you ever shot what is the deadliest gun available I trained with a judo Olympian who refused to train with men no lethal Force have you trained are you more educated on it um anyways I'm not trained but we've established that I'm not shooting people MH regardless back to the original question that you were saying about the guards why doesn't this happen in real life okay well not as many women are interested um that's I but we're selecting from a pool who are interested yeah I'm saying that St a prison with the selection of what is interested that definitely fits the criteria that you put from the yeah why couldn't you I because I don't think why couldn't you go why couldn't you go all around the United States to select for these guards right and say okay we want do you we'll pay you to a big bonus to come relocate over here and you can have be in this all female prison just just trying to go on that massive hunt across the United States prisons to find the women who are the top caliber um of shooting and accuracy seems like a brilliant Financial move no it seems awful financially cuz just a startup cost a loan that's what all companies do this all companies scour the world for talent Google scour the world for talent okay yeah Google why wouldn't a prison system multi billion dollar company is very different than your local prison system who's also trying to just probably I could staff tomorrow also on all female Force right that I knew for sure I could pay less money than the male counterparts in a similar business around me I'd be raking it the [ __ ] in what are you talking about I first of all I don't think it would be substantially enough the level that you'd be paying them less would be enough to overset the onset startup cost of finding these women the highest cost in a business is payroll yeah but there's startup costs you know like a start like yeah that's what investors are for they're looking at the long game 25 years they're not going to going to get a dime back for 25 years what do you mean yeah and these people also it would not just be a one-time startup cost cuz women would obviously leave and you're trying to find not just any woman you're trying to find the top top top caliber woman as no not the top top top caliber all we're trying to do is find women who generally right can reload their weapons faster and do better shot placement than the women or than the men there's got to be millions of those yeah no well here first of all I don't know how many of the those are prison guards first of all as we've established before I I said oh the number is probably like pretty low oh there's tons of female prisons worldwide tons yeah but how many prison female guards well I mean how many would you need let's say you needed a 100 he couldn't find a 100 yeah I think you would have to literally again as I stated before spend a [ __ ] ton of money scour for talent you have you have to do that if it's all men well no I don't think most P prisons are looking for top Caliber men to be prison guards what are they looking for they're looking for people who meet the basic requirements which is that um they're [ __ ] strong right that they can yeah that they can that they can manhandle inmates and that they can deal with the rigors of a prison in your case you would staff your entire prison with women even if we gave them these characteristics it seems like you're just trying to avoid the idea that even if you could find them with these characteristics and bring them in right and pay them less money why how would that be a bad financial decision you've already invested your life savings in such a prison no because the reason why is because I'm telling you the startup cost alone of finding those woman um and you're saying like this would have to be like a continuous thing so you know people would be dropping out coming back in every business ever yeah I I don't think what is I don't think in general unless if you're a multi-billion dollar company like Google um you should be spending a significant amount of your resources scouring for like the number one Talent or whatever let's say if you can get it you could get State funding it's going to be a small prison it only requires 10 mail guards on staff day and night so you're rotating just 20 people that's it okay but the state is they want you to house the worst of the worst so they're giving you a larger stien than they are anywhere else yeah that is the case and you could cut down in your private prison the payroll cost you can't revolve 20 [ __ ] women I think what is it when you're you're acting as first of all the pay Gap is so like exponentially huge I don't necessarily think is a case I think there might be a pay Gap I don't think it's necessarily this idea of you not going into it because of the stigma also is reduced immediately it's reduced no it's reduced a pool of possible applicants let's start there not much if it's just a tiny pay Gap right no because there's a difference as I've stated before between um let's say an Institutional stigma versus a social stigma so you can have a job that still pays pretty well it doesn't necessarily take away the social stigma of being part of that job yeah so I oh let's use garbage people I just want I just want to make sure uh yeah let's okay let's use garbage people yeah so when it comes to like garbage let's say specifically like garbage men in um New York they get paid really well they get paid like bank but I would say that in our society we don't really value people who pick up garbage I don't think that should be the case I think those people are very necessary and vable for a society to survive bunch of female garbage men um I don't think it matters the point that I'm trying to get across here okay is that it's a clear example of something that can pay very well but still has a social stigma attached to it okay but wouldn't that be a social stigma for men and women yeah but it doesn't matter cuz what I'm trying to get across here is that you're saying oh look at this example like you see they're paying well not really sure that there's a huge social stigma against garbage men honestly I think um I really don't think so I don't think anybody's like oh your dad your dad is I yeah I don't think so I don't think so think I don't think there's a big social stigma I think there's usually I think in I think that women aren't garbage men because um they don't want to [ __ ] do that job and uh it's physically laborious women don't want do most people don't want to H you know the most people don't want to do physically laborious jobs I think you're going to have to back that up because as it as it turns out men when they're pulled on this actually do enjoy physically laborious jobs and that's why they gravitate towards him the idea that kind of the Socialists Like You on the left say ah nobody wants to do a physically intensive job actually there's quite a few people who only want to do physically intensive jobs they get bored at a desk they don't like working inside any number of different reason the point is that our society and hopefully we can just agree on this doesn't really value physical labor maybe as much as it should yeah I think I think it does I think maybe women don't I I don't think maybe women don't value it because they don't do any of those jobs so they don't know how valuable they are I think if that was the case you would see um a lot return to the trades which we're seeing overwhelmingly that you would see tons of men gravitating towards more of the trades job which they're now doing overwhelmingly I first of all I don't know about the word overwhelmingly second of all um I think you would see like basically their pay to be that or equal that of like CEOs essentially or scientists or doctors or lawy yeah electricians are making pretty close to what scientists are making yeah I don't think that's true it is true in fact if you look at nurses nurses often will make pretty close to what like a social scientist might make or close to what a university scientist might even make they may not continur they make something similar Master electricians they make often what nurses I know what is it I know that there's certain physical labor jobs that are getting paid very well right now trade jobs yeah trade jobs all trade jobs I don't know about all trade jobs but even if I grant that two things again um there is still a stigma that is hopefully changing the stigma is still kind of there though second of all from men um not from both men and women honestly I don't think there's a big stigma towards the traits from men I think since men are the ones who were doing all the tra this a class thing honestly um I think it is like a class sort of thing not even like men or men versus women I think there is some level of upper society that views getting your hands dirty as a dirty thing women will often consider themselves in prestigious jobs that aren't particularly prestigious and well often I think the stigma towards the trades comes from females who look down on the trades not because men I don't think men are looking down on the TR CEOs and other yeah I I don't know like I feel like you keep making this a men and women thing and I just think honestly it is a class-based thing I also think um across the world you said that women are moving towards prestigious jobs yeah I think both men and so isn't that boosting them up in the class in their own mind um class Dynamics are very complicated you say that a lot you say it's complicated Dynamic it's multifaceted AB no yeah yeah I think Society is complicated but I think most ideas can be reduced to singular core principles or singular core things which the idea expands from and what I think happens here a lot is you say it's complex it's multifaceted there's a lot of factors here as a mode of of offis I you don't want to answer like forance when you say I would invest my life savings in that female prison hang on if I yeah that was the question I said between these two prisons would you invest your life savings in this one or that one if you only had the choice between the two you say the woman's prison I actually don't believe you I literally don't believe you it's not believable to me that you would say that you don't have to believe me um from my perspective and point of view when it comes to that example are specifically specified to me it depends on speed and accuracy going back to the trade jobs I also think um when we look globally yeah most people in let's say like let's use China for example who are working hard labor jobs are not getting paid very well um most people globally who are doing hard what is it labor jobs are not getting paid very well um I think part of the reason why these jobs are have historically not anymore hopefully it's changing for the better I agree that they should be more respect Labor's labor um call me a socialist hippie I don't care um part of the reason for this is because for a long time it was seen as something that anybody can learn anybody can learn a trade if they really want to whatever um now we've moved so much to service Society that not as many people are learning how to do that labor so that creates a higher demand for that labor because there's not as much people who are willing to supply that cuz they can't um I still don't think the stigma has completely reversed or changed I think that there are more people talking about how those jobs should be valued which I agree with um but I still think that the vast majority of people are told you go to college go to college go to college go to college go to college but I mean that's being pushed towards women the female Dynamic I I think what is it a lot of men most most women are it's if you look at the vast majority of college graduates it's women right yeah so so the reason for this is because women are the ones who are being appealed to to go to college men are often appealed to to go into the trades this is why I this further Evidence by the way that kind of this social stigma that you're talking about is coming down from women not coming down from men men are being encouraged to go into trades women are the ones who are being encouraged to go to college and waste their [ __ ] time getting a a degree in basket weaving I promise you that there is no son of any CEO or any super high paying person in power who's telling their son like oh go do a trade instead they're being taught to essentially take over the family business Ulus the Pagan donated $100 prisons have had multiple prison riots over the decades many cases the all male correctional officers were overwhelmed locals state enforcement and Military were brought in women would Faire better under her logic they would yeah no I think again as I stated before we were talking about like top ealon people I don't think the average all woman prison facility versus average the criteria that specifically no your criteria was two things what was the criteria it was speed and accuracy that's not the highest Echelon of women all they would need to do is have an advantage over the men in this criteria one think the average prison guard woman is more faster more or accurate than the average I don't think that that would be the deciding requirement on being able to run a prison nor quell any prison riots would that be that they were they reloaded faster and shot you here instead of there I don't think that those are significant markers I think the reason why I the significant marker I think is physical strength the reason why bring up speed is not just reloading speed it's shooting you speed it's me pulling the gun or sorry the trigger fast enough before you get to me yeah I get it okay yeah I still think that physical strength is going to be the dominant power here and the reason that physical strength is going to be the dominant power is because even if you have a gun if four guys are coming at you even if you're really quick Wyatt her okay they can over [ __ ] whelm you very quickly menare very very good in those scenarios women very bad and you also have an additional incentive which is that a lot of those prison uh prisoners in this prison you would invest in would want to do what thing to all those female prison guards well that's why when we brought up the example again I specifically asked you is it still the case or is it the case that the women are seen as like catty [ __ ] essentially and what I granted to you was qu the only for career change are you fast and accurate with a pew pew I'm pixie and join me and my new business venture in Alternative Correctional Facilities only only prisoners yeah show us what you got so I I granted I granted everything you said that there was just these two criteria so I gave you only the two criteria that's why I'm confused you ask for that's why I'm stop stop let me finish asking me for additional qualifiers has nothing to do with anything we're saying that they're going to be still females they're just going to fit the two qualifiers that you have yeah that's why I'm confused when the person said the comment and you were like oh what else do men want to do with women because in the example that we were talking about you specifically stated no like the only thing that matters here like there's no additional Factor so maybe I misunderstood what you said this is these are still females everything else is equal between how females would be treated in prison and how men are treated in prison minus these two criteria I was very clear and specific about that isn't taking Force escalation into account men will be better equipped to prevent escalation into a shooting because they have more tools in the tool box female cops tend to go straight to gun yeah but we can just grant it because when we Grant it and we show that she's only compensating for these two things which is speed and accuracy we left everything else equal I gave it all to you that's why and so what you say instead is okay so even knowing that it's equal that it meaning every other criteria of a woman would still exist which is what I put in the hypothetical you still would have invested your life savings in this female prison because of only these two Criterion I specifically asked you if it was the case that oh you know the men the prison men whatever didn't respect the women or viewed them as catty [ __ ] and you said they're treated the same as the guys I'm granting you that they're like equal in all those senses except the speed and accuracy no they're equal in all of their training okay so it's not the case to clarify that the prison the inmates respect the woman the same way they respect the man you're saying that's not the case I'm I'm just only granting you these two things which is you want speed and accuracy and you would invest your life savings based on those two criteria confused because earlier you said everything no I'm not office I feel like you're not I feel I we need to play it back again do I do you need to get me dinner tomorrow too you're literally jumping back and forth I'm trying to ask a clarifying question and then you're I don't know how else I can clarify this all other criteria are completely equal to how it would be viewed in modernity minus two attribut stop minus two attributes the two that you demanded and accur criteria is equal then you're also saying the way that the inmates are treating the why you got to talk less you got to talk less you have to say all criteria are equal can we go back a minut please stop pixie I said all criteria are equal as to that in general Society you only heard part cuz you can't shut up long enough to listen stop talking stop let me finish all everything is equal to how it would be in general Society with men and women minus however they're viewed right by anybody at any time in any given Arena it's equal to that now minus these two attributes that's it okay I was very clear about that and you're just kind of wanting to change the scenario now I'm trying to understand what your scenario exactly is it's just too complex no because you're using how many how many attributes do we have your word play is literally jumping around many attributes do we have that we're looking at we're saying that there's two so you're saying all else is equal yes or no no well no when I say all else is equal to what all else is equal to those two attributes to General Society to General Society okay you did not say General Society before two attributes you're saying you're saying you're granting me everything except the two attributes that we're changing and now you're going back and saying no no no no General Society I'm granting you that there's the same women they're the same everything only jump back and forth and see I have said these two attributes 50 times these are the only differences yes can you understand how it might be confusing when you say these are the only two differences and then when I ask the only two differ and then when I ask you for clarification if men and women are being treated equally you're saying oh no the only two differences are the accuracy your clarification came question that's one and two here's the thing I you already answered it before you asked for the clarifier you already answered it that's why I as the clarifier so let's do it again let's do it again these are the two attributes that you want to see those are the only two that matter to pixie yes or no cuz you said yes I said if we're saying if everything else is equal if men and women are being viewed equally the same treated equally the same and the only difference is that the women are faster and more accurate then that's a different answer versus oh no the men and women are still viewed differently they're viewing the woman of all of the men inside of this prison right they want to kill all of the men and they want to kill all of the women doesn't matter who's guarding them they want to kill them and get out okay doesn't matter both sides okay okay Derek we got that clear okay repeat it back to me you're saying the prisoners in either scenario want to just kill and get away they want to kill them and they want to get away that's all they want to do they're going to plot it they're going to do whatever they need to do to do that okay the two attributes we have the two attributes the women have an edge on those attributes okay okay one of them they're much better their shot placement is not here right it's it's much much more centered okay and the men are kind of hitting all over the place in inside inside of something like this no they still hit but they're all over group their group is much wider however these women are much quicker and they are much more accurate we have the two attributes we know now what the prisoners view them as you have everything which prison you investing your life savings in if you had to invest it in one I have an additional question I just thought of course you do no I'm not this is not mean to be bad this is total okay it's not me fine go ahead what is it what's the question okay they're usually linked but not always um stamina uh-huh is do are the men do the men have more stamina or do the women have more St by stamina um if after shooting five times or whatever it's harder for the women to keep they're basically the accurac accuracy as it turns out they're still women yes they are still women so they have the same on average stamina that a normal prison guard woman would have but they do they are indeed faster with their guns they do indeed have better shot placement with their guns but they are still women unfortunately in this scenario and yes the the prisoners want to escape right they just want to get rid of these guards and go okay that's what you know before you're investing which prison are you investing in okay now this becomes a math problem um my first instinct is still accuracy and speed but if you're saying their stamina is significantly lower than the men then now I'm leaning more towards the men just because it would be really bad if the scenar well the scenario would eventually become their stamina would affect their speed and accuracy essentially because it's hard to do the same action over and over again if you're losing stamina essentially so if they had similar levels of stamina obviously as I thought the original question was only speed and accuracy were changed um then speed and accuracy would still win but if you're telling me the stamina is significantly lower than the per person who has stamina no I was women they're but wait I thought as long as the women could shoot better and were faster that's what you really cared about cuz all that matters is when the bullet hits they're down yes then then why so are we going to go ahead and invest in the woman's savings or not the reason why I bring up stamina now or the reason why it's as important is because if you have I thought all it was important is that the bullet hit them um yes that is the most important part mhm but speed and accuracy yes but here's the deal here's here's the only scenario where that would change okay if you have 1 2 3 4 5 Let's Pretend This is 10 men this is not 10 men but let's pretend let's say you have 10 men we got 10 men yes mhm um and you have the person shooting right uh-huh but that say after the fourth man they're too tired to continue shooting uhhuh then they're [ __ ] Bas essentially so which one are we investing in um so if you're telling me the men are less accurate and less fast but their stamina could take over all the other guys I didn't say that I said that these are just going to have the normal stamina of a female prison guard normal stamina of a male prison guard okay um yeah I don't like I'm going to assume that the normal stamina of the guy is more than the normal stamina of the woman it seems like a safe assumption okay then I would say the guy um so which prison are you investing in the male one the male one okay if the stamina is that much significantly more important so then so then men are even if the women are more accurate and can shoot better you still would invest in the male prison because there's still going to be better prison guards overall um the only problem I can see is it doesn't matter how much stamina you have if your accuracy is [ __ ] oh yeah so which one again well no it's a [ __ ] math problem that's the problem that's where you have put me at I would literally have to like sit down I'm not even joking I would have to sit down I would have to look at the average stamas I would have to look at like the the prison inmates themselves essentially and I'd literally have to figure out how that's fair what would your intuition tell you right now based on the information you have my intuition would say that hey if there's stamina and they're let's say fairly competent or whatever then I would go with the guys cuz they have more stamina but again if in this scenario they have stamina but their accuracy is [ __ ] then I would go with a woman because if your accuracy see [ __ ] it doesn't matter if you have a lot of stamina if somebody gets [ __ ] the knowledge that you have these are women these are men you can make whatever assumptions you want from there but you do know for sure that the women can shoot better and they have much tighter groups they're faster and they can shoot with more accuracy you can put your life savings in one which one would you put it in okay um I'm going back and forth I would it's a math problem I would say right now I'm going with stamina as a number one thing because it doesn't matter how accurate and fast you are so we're going with the men okay sure yeah is that right for now yeah okay so you think that men even if women can shoot better and are faster still would have an advantage what do you mean okay you're saying oh with the what is it female prison guards or whatever yes they would have an advantage even then if okay are you talking about sorry male Guard versus woman guard are you talking about male prison prison I'm talking about in okay so we're not going to offis skate anymore I don't know if you need to take an Aderall pill but I've been super clear so we have two attributes right one and two are our attributes okay we know only that you have males in one prison who are going to guard it and females in the other prison who are going to guard it okay but you do only know that these two attributes one and two those two attributes for the women are going to be superior than that of the men in some cases significantly Superior okay in the case of speed it's going to be significant significant difference last question what's the ratio of prison guard to person I do have to move this on soon so whatever the averag is let's say 6 to1 ah then yeah accuracy and speed accuracy and speed now let's say it's 20 to1 stamina okay now let's say it's 100 to one um stamina stamina again yes okay so if you had a 100 to1 ratio of prison guard to prisoner or 50 to to to one you would still take them in if the yeah stamina even though we've created now many many more targets right so I guess speed I guess speed and accuracy is not our most important attribute but strength also it becomes yeah like it becomes a basically essentially like math problem like if we're just doing um one to1 essentially spe so your intuition though says you would invest in the male prison right if the population is large enough then yeah okay yeah so I mean when it comes to force Doctrine even if we take your two Criterion for guns turns out ah not really the truth that that's your real Criterion here for Force Doctrine is it because no I'm sorry I do have to move it on a little bit we have been on the topic for a long time we do have a super chat here from Paul Jame OMG I'm losing brain cells listening to her argument something that goes around and around like a merry go around dumb down your ego stop arguing it makes no sense or trying to one an escape stop talking King and listen okay thank you Paul J appreciate your super chat now I did have a question for you uh Pixie so uh you're a feminist you believe in equality what are your thoughts on the buying the In-N-Out later what are your thoughts on the buying what are your thoughts on that I mean are you going to are you going to hold your bet you didn't I can actually also we can give you an out here for the rest of the show we have an In-N-Out hat you don't have to buy us In-N-Out if you the hat for the rest of the show that seems fair is that is that a fair compromise I don't think I owe the In-N-Out um I kind of do want to see the Hat though there's also a uh I think there's a doesn't ow the In-N-Out what what's there's a d definitely owe the in out or the In-N-Out you definitely owe it sorry you guys did make a bet didn't you for totally said won physical application and I was literally physical applicationing grab that physical engineering you said physical you want me to grab that in and out I think you would look good honestly in the in the in and out hat you want to just grab it really quick it's it's uh right next to the Fedora so it's like a white it's just white paper you'll see it it's right by the game boys no's the yeah that one right there perfect boom I'll do it for the memes for the memes you don't have to wear I mean you don't have to wear for the whole show but be in and out prison boom ready for Duty look at your future pixie looks good all right uh it kind of matches I look like a sailor a little bit right now that's a good look it's a good look um so really quick so currently the State of Affairs when it comes to the Selective Service System the draft uh men are required to register for the selective service women are not what are your thoughts on this that's [ __ ] up I don't think men should be required to be drafted well assuming in a country where the draft would not be able to be legislated way the government will never relinquish relinquish excuse me its right to uh draft from its citizenry do you think then that women should also be drafted um yes but and would that be equality and Equity um I guess I'm indifferent honestly I think um what is it I don't think anybody should be drafted um I know you're saying in a system where you have to either pick one or the other and then the other option is essentially gone then yeah I rather have both men and women have essentially like equal suffering in that rest respect I guess I don't know mhm would you assume that in such a system where a draft was there mhm that men would still be deployed into combat situations far more than women would even if women were to get drafted um probably because what is it I don't know cuz you're saying in such a society or whatever we would assume like this one if we had a draft tomorrow where then yeah I think men would probably be picked more I think um part of an example of how like people think that the patriarchy doesn't negatively affect men and I think it does in certain ways and I think this is like one of the ways where um men are expected and essentially like burdened to have um or have like these basically expectations of having to protect always um even in the detriment of their own life and I don't think it's fair for the government to be able to dictate that in such a way so I mean aren't men going to make better soldiers um to me it's not a question about whether men make better soldiers or not to me it's a question about should the government have a right to put your life on the line we're assuming they have the right like for and for instance you don't really believe that like if the United States was attacked right you don't think that the government shouldn't be able to draft its citizens to repel attack I don't I don't think um what is it I think it has to be then how do you have a nation volunteer basis like essentially but if you don't have enough volunteers and your country is being attacked you think that then your country doesn't deserve to survive if not enough people are willing to take up arms against a foreign Predator yeah but I mean you do realize that if you were to take volunteer service for instance if you if you have a draft you can recall people who have been in the armed forces who have some training that you can immediately deploy versus brand new fresh-faced people who then you have to train I guess let me it what I'm assuming we're talking about here is a mandatory draft so it's I pick you you have to go and if not the government won't that's true but that would also include as a subset people have former military training yeah I think um we should differentiate I think if those if the former military but it's an entailment you can't differentiate it's an it's entailed those people want to go and fight for the country great awesome I don't think you should force those people yeah that's great but that's not the question the question is not whether or not you think that that should happen the question is if you have a draft the entailment of having a draft is that people who have formerly served are going to get drafted okay how is that a question okay that's an entailment I need you to agree that that's an entailment of that CU earlier you were saying that it wasn't so I just want to make sure it is what do you mean by aail please clarify it means that if you're drafting everybody yeah then the pool of people who have formally served will also get drafted okay that's not a question no I it's an entailment so I just asked you to acknowledge the entailment okay yes they will draft people who had former experience yes okay so if you're going to do a draft right the logic behind it also would be that you can then call up soldiers quickly who have had some kind of training sure yeah so then if you're only dealing on a volunteer basis a volunteer force and your country is attacked by a much larger Force then wouldn't you want the systems in place for conscription so that you could quickly feel men into battle starting with people who have former military experience to save the enemy off as you train new soldiers you can create a system where those people are basically on standby or Reserve so then yeah but if it's voluntary it would defeat the purpose of conscription what is it I mean again I don't think the draft should be a thing I think we can have a system in place or let's call it draft light whatever whatever you want to call it um where people volunteer their services in case there is such a situation but I don't think you should be able to force an individual ever under any circumstances to put their life on the line for the government uh well no for their own Nation there that's I I don't think I think often times like for instance you you realize governments can be subverted for instance yeah I realize government and you realize that inside of this type of subversion you can have like surprise attacks nobody's prepared for right you can have all sorts of different things happen where you would need to call up soldiers very very quickly whether they wanted to go or not yes um I think in the history of the United States most of the time it is not necessarily a surprise attack like that um so so what CU I how realistic the scenarios are but regardless wait wait that's that's a very realistic scenario that you could be so in fact what was was Pearl Har surprise attack yeah the one and only that was a pretty big surp no not the one and only that too no not just 911 either okay well no many many surprise attacks War of 1812 started with a surprise attack by the way the Civil War started with a surprise attack can we compare no no let's compare stop cutting me off I'm not done the Civil War started with a surprise attack how many of those Wars can we compare with like Wars the United States has been a part of or has directly been involved in that are not surprised those Wars don't have conscripts so World War II had a was a conscription War yeah uh and then if you go back to the Civil War there was conscription during the Civil War as well those were those were our big surprise attacks what about Vietnam yeah Vietnam there was a draft but not very many people actually got drafted interestingly enough was there a conscription in the Korean War I think there was yeah a twoyear war yeah yeah there's the point that I'm trying to get across but the major the two major ones both of them seem to fit this criteria um the point that I'm trying to get across is that I think that yeah you should not force the general populace to essentially or any individual to be part of a war they don't want to be part of I think I just think that's fundamentally not okay for a government to do and the reason why is because I'm sure we can agree there are times where the government doesn't necessarily have the best interest at heart when it comes to going to war so I just want to take this to its logical conclusion then so if Russia um had some [ __ ] big windfall of wealth and came to the shores of the United States and said okay I'm going to bribe all of you to join our military and invade by by giving each of you a every man in the United States a million bucks okay to join our army and take over if if the the citizenry of the United States agreed to that men right or just a large portion of them let's say the fighting age like 10% okay joined the ruskies and attacked us you'd be okay with that because of voluntarism it's not that I'd be okay with it it's just basically at that point I guess yeah the nation deserves to die at that point if your nation does not have enough people who are willing to volunteer to fight for it and is willing to give up to so if another Nation bribes a portion of ours to go turncoat and join their military in order to take ours out you don't believe that our military should or our our government should be able to conscript its citizens to fight this nation off I think a nation that doesn't have enough people willing to line up to fight against these people um is a nation that's already dead to begin with essentially I don't think also let larger military what in what world is example that you're giving up or giving us would not be applicable to the people who got drafted like what what cuz if Russia has a large windfall of wealth or whatever and it's like Hey guys you're a military and we'll give you like a million dollars would it not also be in Russia's best interest to say like hey defect from the military and we'll give you a million but then you have patriotism and consequence of patriotism yeah and patriotism and consequence of patriotism should either exist in the country before but under your but under your scenario they're not Traders what do you mean they're not tra what are they doing wrong they are I still think they're Traders they're not wait traders to what to the nation they're going for an enemy constrict instead they've decided that so they're traitor but you don't care if they join the enemy because you deserve it it's not that I don't care if they join the enemy it's just that I believe that the strength of the nation should be strong enough to have people being willing to take up arms a volunteer if you haven't cre that then your nation is let me give you the major scenario then the major scenario is you cannot reveal to the public how strong the enemy actually is because it would be strategically disadvantageous you you can't actually tell them how big this threat is you can't tell them where this threat is and the reason that you can't tell them this is because then the enemy will know and then they will use that to their advantage to destroy your army so because you have to keep that secretive right you might not be able to give the general public enough information to know why it is that they should be joining to protect their country so in that case wouldn't conscription be a viable option I I there's still something on ethical about it um mainly saying Bas mainly speaking that you're essentially taking away people's choice um you sometimes need to do that um I think there are times where you can take away choices I don't think you should ever be able to play a roulette with a person's life without their consent yeah but again this goes back to I mean I just got to know in this scenario yeah no the government sees that there's an overwhelming Force but cannot announce this to the American public because if they were to say to the American public that they knew about how overwhelming this Force really was and why it is people needed to volunteer to protect the nation uh that that would give away that they knew this critical information and so instead they used conscription and quietly began to conscript people into the Armed Forces why would that why would that be a problem final thing from pixie and I'll move it on go ahead because ultimately what you're doing is that you're taking people as like individual right um to determine essentially if they're going to live or die I think at that point what you should do is you should offer basically extremely high incentives for them to join which is basically like hey after you know this war or after this don't have time we need them now okay I'm sorry I do have to move things I got to have answer to that last thing I we need them now I don't I don't think you should be able to play roulette with a person's life um under any circumstance I just I okay yeah all right I do want to touch on briefly the topic of get back to feminism get back to patriarchy uh one question for you though pixie uh if you could would you ban men from being able to vote on anything related to abortion rights no okay that was my question um really quick I think this would be good I guess bringing it back to the very beginning how do you each Define feminism pixie I'll she has not actually defined it I'll have go first um we're using basically the working definition that we said earlier before no I'm asking for yours basically again feminism is super duper broad the way I personally would describe it would be um the movement slash ideology of trying to create a system where men and women have equality or like equal opportunity I essentially so if the if the system was patriarchal in order to achieve equality you would need to dismantle patriarchal systems right yeah okay so then my definition of feminism is the movement towards egalitarianism and the dismantling of patriarchy follows right yeah it does follow so then you basically utilize my definition of feminism well that's why we agreed in the beginning I said yeah let's go let's use that definition yeah but but saying let's use it doesn't mean you agree with it it's because I'm not and I know you're like oh you're offis skating like you're making this so much more complicated than it is no I'm fine with that if it has a point and it's not actually aisc Okay the reason why I'm not being super strict with the definition of feminism is because since feminism is such a broad topic um somebody can easily bring up I I don't know if this will happen I can't think of one from the top of my head but if another definition is brought up um that also makes sense I would be open to using that definition as well yeah that makes sense yeah yeah I'm not I'm the only I'm just holding you to some kind of standard we can operate off of I understand it could be broader than the standard but at least the standard gives us something to talk around right yeah okay so whether it's mine or yours um so I wanted to move past the you're granting Me Mine into this is a definition that at its core you kind of agree is also true Okay so so that would be the definition do we live in a patriarchy um I'd say we do otherwise what could she dismantle yeah and what is did we Define patriarchy earlier what is a patriarchy what is the patriarchy basically the patriarchy is I don't even say necessarily like a system of governments but a system of like societal structure where men have more power on the basis of being men men have more power on the basis of being men yes like basically being a male in the system MH by virtue or whatever because of the way that Society views it grants you with automatically some level of power more or respect more is this all men or some men um oh that's a good question um I kind of want some men honestly cuz even if you try to argue that like oh no men in general or even even if we say men in general the point being is that there are certain men out there who do not meet the standards of what it means to be a man like societally and as of return they're treated very very badly look down upon like at the same level of like women essentially that's why I would argue that there are some extreme cases like that yeah I don't think patriarchy has anything to do with status so my definition is just of the father so this just means that men are in charge of [ __ ] they're in charge of something yeah that would be a patriarchal system that men are in charge of it um I think um so status itself to me how Society views it um I don't actually care about I don't actually care about the entailment of the societal viewing of men having more or less status because arguably right now I would say that men are not looked at as having more status than women in this society would you I think in certain areas like I think um men B basically women can exhibit some of the same behaviors men have and they'll be looked down upon it essentially like um straightforwardness assertiveness um just domineering Behavior they're looked they're looked down on Often by other women for that and Men both yeah but I mean men and women also look down on men if they're not exhibiting proper masculine qualities yeah I agree but why would that be patriarchal it's patriarchal because it puts men in an inherit like benefit for acting you haven't demonstrated you haven't demonstrated the benefit you just said wom don't act like women they get they get pun there's a punishment for it but the same with men the benefit is that if what is it the benefit is basically they're more likely to be promoted to be you know yeah essentially put into Power because they're acting like men that's the point if I'm a woman if let's say you know how we were talking about human characteris demonstration of that okay easy um let's take a man and a woman mhm and let's say they're both you know trying to get this like CEO position whatever they're trying to apply for it and they're getting interviewed by the like basically they're interviewing the subordinates to see like who's better blah blah blah blah if a woman is as assertive as a guy is or has been towards her subordinates they're usually seen as like [ __ ] or they're usually seen as like pain in the ass or whatever while the guy is more likely to be seen as no he's just assertive he just knows what he wants So based on this the woman is more likely to be like penalized to not get that position to be looked down upon because she is exhibiting the same attribute that the man is which is being assertive or but that doesn't demonstrate because we view men and women a certain way based on their their um their ontology and the physicality and the way that they actually operate that there's no advantages that are equal to this Advantage you perceive in the CEO aspect to women and if that is the case then the idea that men are have certain advantages and women have other certain advantages still wouldn't make it patriarchal if we're looking at status well we're well first of all can you give me an example and then second of all yeah let me give you a tons of examples where Women's status is uh very helpful to them just by being women where it's not for men before I I said first of all but then second of all um well can we do one at a time so we don't get bogged down in this we have to answer Five Points at a time let's do one at a time they they're intertwined cuz I was going to say like second of all even in cases where oh a woman has an advantage because she's acting womanly versus a man who's act you know has an advantage because he's acting like manly or whatever um the argument here is just not are there advantages to being a woman or a man advantages being both the one is which one is more likely to put you in a position of power uh okay but when you're talking about status you agree with me that power comes in many forms yes is that correct yes okay so if we're talking about status don't you think that it's a very powerful position to women for women to be in to be the default when it comes to custodial agreements of children um yes but it's usually not because you're woman it's usually because they're the primary caretaker NOP it's traditionally just been because they're women in fact there's laws which governed this for years and years just because woman instant custody because women even right now that's carried on the same exact way that it is in the CEO idea so this is going to be case specific some men aren't going to look at women applying for a CEO job and say oh she's being a [ __ ] therefore she's gone they might prefer assertive women in those positions some men maybe not and and maybe it's the majority of those some men who don't want uh that assertiveness uh that they would prefer an a man great okay so maybe that gives uh uh men an advantage in that particular criteria however the status of women is also advantageous in other areas so I'm not confident that using your definition of status proves patriarchy if women are advantaged in different areas okay I don't think well here's a here's a few things the first one I want to ask you is if you could give me a specific study so that I can look out specifically of um like in recent era here's one we can agree on easily for the same crime same crime including violent crimes women get lesser sentences than men yes absolutely um that is an advantage it's an advantage massive Advantage I said that's an advantage yes and again as I said before there are certain advantages women have under the patriarchy that would fall under status yes that your status merely as being a woman is assisting you yeah I agree with that but that's also because women are viewed as weaker they're not viewed as much as a threat they are viewed it's it's a status that is lower it's essentially saying like oh you know I view you the same way I would view like you know like a cat trying to like CLM me like you're not that much of a threat so I'm not going to punish you as much because you know who the [ __ ] cares you're just a woman so that is maybe it's an advantage towards Wom but it's [ __ ] up and it shouldn't be that way who cares it's still a status which is enjoyed and a privilege by women but it's notat over men okay first of all again here's our conflicting definitions when you say status right I say patriarchies of the father men are in charge okay that would be a patriarchal system women often as judges in these cases hand down lighter sentences just like the men do this is not a purely male phenomenon all so how could it be patriar what is it again it's patriarchal because the view is that men should be taken more seriously than women they are by even including women yes I'm not so how could that be mat or patriarchy why the P again there is the is the patriarchy brainwashing them to believe that no unironically yes un ironically yeah no women are women do uphold the patriarchy I've never disagreed with this the whole idea I think that women are upholding um the idea that women are less of a threat I think that women uphold the idea that women deserve to have custody I think that women use the stats including femin no feminist specifically use stats all the time everywhere saying hang on let me finish my argument saying this saying that men are hyper predatory because they're hyper predatory this is why they're viewed as being Predators they should be viewed this way women should get lighter sentences they don't do as much crime as men do women enforce this narrative not men I think both men and women narative think feminists we literally had a conversation for the past 2 hours where you were telling me how men you know if they decided to go and kill everybody or kill all woman they could because they have the Monopoly on power you are enforcing the same patriarchy that now you're saying oh no it's women who are actually doing this not me I'm giving you a logical argumentation that rights themselves are come only because men allow women to have those rights do I think that the default is that men will be in charge indefinitely in some capacity yes but your definition is status yes status so men could conceivably be in charge and women still have a higher status which would make it in your definition not a patriarchy no I think what is it power and Status are often interl not always more yeah more often than not though um when you are prove it okay um who is the most powerful person in the world right now I don't know I'd argue the president of the United States M yeah and that would that would be an argue yeah I guess historically speaking I wouldn't say that that's a high status job anymore though okay well we'll agree to disagree that what did do you think when Trump was in office that the presidency was a really high status job yeah I think it still was I think it literally being the president of the United States who's about to be KLA is probably it's the most I would AR is KLA right now about to be the president possibly we'll find out but if she is then is it a matriarchy then cuz she has the highest status as again I stated before it would be like a general system um just having one CEO one woman CEO one woman president one woman in power doesn't necessarily dism the entire system no it would or similar it would have to be pretty so I don't understand how come th tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of women can enjoy the status and privilege of custodial agreements getting lighter sentences having their doors open for them making sure that their all of their meals are bought for them making sure that Society in and of itself caters to them uh in a way that they do not cater back to society they're not doing the most dangerous jobs in the world the mortality rates inside of men's Workforce versus women are AST [ __ ] because women can't do the jobs men can do seems like you have a much higher status in society than men do we're viewed as interchangeable Expendable widgets you know if women really had like that same level of status that men do um you would expect that to carry out more in the workforce too you'd expect them to have let's say like more positions of power you'd expect them to have more positions of governance you would expect it to be like around similar numbers but for some reason we don't get that yeah because you don't do don't do anything of status how much status are you going to have as a kindergarten teacher you don't do anything we're talking about women and men who are similar if not the exact same qualifications applying to the same exact jobs and having the men still being picked more oh no is is that so do they enjoy um on some kind of hiring status quo the fact that they don't get [ __ ] pregnant and so they won't have to leave their job for 9 months out of the [ __ ] year and they won't have to stay home and take extended vacations which is what women demand and men don't from an employer standpoint male or female makes sense doesn't it that's not a status it doesn't it really doesn't make sense because one you're presupposing that every woman who applies to the job ever is going to get [ __ ] pregnant and then second of all for the society that I'm advocating for both men and women would get equal levels of paternity and maternity oh great that's that's nice but unfortunately it doesn't work out that way equally hang on my turn I just listened my turn to respond so just so you know if you are running a company which is hiring a lot of men and women you would probably just make general policies general policies not individualistic policies you and I can both agree that only females can get pregnant right yeah only only females can get pregnant no males ever can get pregnant ever can I oh I don't want to derail what no no males can become pregnant you can answer the question you can answer okay um do you consider a person with XY chromosomes male or female no you can be a male and have um a double X chromosome depending on your biology but you can still be a male you only have two how do you define male that would be somebody who follows the typified pathway for female or male so your organs your body can only have X amount of organs those organs are going to be even in chimeras this is true you're only going to have one reproductive pathway that's viable and so you can determine the sex that way so you agree that I'm just curious I'm just generally curious so there are people who have XY chromosomes that can get pregnant um yeah so what so they're a woman or men no again didn't I just say that it had nothing to do with chromosomes repeat no no that's why that's why I'm clarifying st stop repeat back to me what I told you what is a male and a female from my definition you said it depends on the reproductive status essentially that there's I let me try it again let me try it again you can only as a human being have one of two viable reproductive Pathways that's why literally I didn't say reproductive status because there's women without uteruses who are still females okay sorry for Miss it's important that we make this distinction and do you know why it's important to make this distinction because women who obviously can't have children this but they're still quite female okay so it's a reproductive pathway yes it's the the one of two reproductive Pathways your body is capable of going down and there's only two okay and so okay I'm just curious and because of the whole trans athlete well they're not trans but because you mean the female huh you mean the female athlete yeah and that there were a bunch of people yeah that was a female okay cool awesome I'm glad we agree yeah I mean I used it as a as a great way to uh to bash on the te's because I like to do that but um but yes that was a female Okay cool so one of two reproductive Pathways which are available no men can become pregnant and it let's assume for a second that because you're like a blue-haired social justice lunatic that that there's at least that there's 10 who could 10 males or 20 or 200 males or even 2,000 we could say with great confidence that almost every every company on planet Earth is never going to have to deal with one okay sure okay so if that is the case then we can reduce this to females only are going to be the carriers of the children so if you are in charge of a company and you are setting a standard for who you want to hire right why would you not set the standard for people who are going to require less in the way of um leaving the company for extended periods of time based on pregnancy based on this based on that I understand what you're trying to say I just think think um fundamentally I would focus more on who has more qualifications or basically who I believe to be more qualified to lead yeah I mean but who cares what you personally would like from the you can Envision from the employer standpoint you're in charge of 500 employees with a revolving I think from the employer standpoint um you can make generalizations about gender but that doesn't necessarily mean you're necess like you're hiring the best person per se if you're making those generalizations on gender so you might be missing some of the top applicants just because they assuming that they can get pregnant so maybe your job I had to is I I want to listen to what you have to say I just have to also run to the bathroom I'm not going to be able to I'll be right back sorry we'll take a little break here yeah I'll have to smoke then do we have enough time for that Maybe not maybe uh this would be a good opportunity for us to plug debate unfortunately I can't really pull it up uh here hold on uh Andrew I'm going I'll run to the computer and we'll plug it real quick sure if you can oh yeah you have to carry the show well I hope you guys are enjoying the debate so far it's been enjoyable for me I don't often get to tangle with the twitch politics lunatics anymore as much as I used to you can get bogged down on some very specific quag Myers but they're all good to get bogged down on because just kind of shows how [ __ ] crazy they are the more you go right we're going to have all Fe prison because you can shoot slightly better [ __ ] crazies dude crazies but what can you do except have the debates because they're fun to have what can you do by the way uh you're looking at verbal combat this is a course put on by myself uh and it has been partnered with whatever podcast in Brian Atlas uh verbal combat if you're enjoying what you see today that is part of verbal combat showing you exactly the case by case for how to have informal debates ton of fun to have it will help you in all aspects of your life though when it comes to uh verbally jousting with any opponent this could be family friends boss it could be a lunatic blue haired feminist like is in the room now obviously who's only missing the destiny die so I would highly recommend you go as fast as possible pick up that course we uh we sure hope that you will you're going to learn a lot there's over a I was going to go out over over I'm sorry over 80 videos 6 hours of content we have a bunch more content we're going to be releasing in the next uh 60 days or so and those of you who have bought the course of course you're going to have access to that at no additional charge you can become a member of the debate group uh we'll be in there a couple times a month uh hosting um Q&A sessions for anything that you guys want to talk about so that's debate university.com and the course you want is verbal combat hope you guys pick it up okay so we're back to this now where the [ __ ] were we um what is it we're talking did you go did you run in the bathroom and read your text message you did didn't you no I left my phone here you could look we'll go back all right I'm just [ __ ] around I know so Brian we're going to about 30 minutes wrap this up okay I'm so hungry yeah I know she's that's why she I know she's D him yeah we'll get Centered for you Brian is that better turn the the mic a little bit this way yeah are you sure SC a little closer to you the microphone it to the edge done well done [Laughter] continue congrats uncore you uncore played uncore yourself donated $100 100% of what you scam as the patriarchy d IES from female sexual selection men must climb hierarchies plus attain power if you didn't demand it it would go away plus you'd have any real shot at equality yeah this is a good point that is brought in that women essentially demand based on sexual selection that men be high status um I'll tell you what though you can prove me wrong right um the dating prospects that you're going to have in the future lower or higher status men um ideally same or somebody who matches me where I'm weak yeah based on your history the men that you've dated have been equally Yol to you or they have been higher status I would say equal equal yeah I would say and is have you ever dated a prominent twitch or YouTube streamer no never no not even once not even I'm I'm I disappeared off the internet for like 3 to four years um so what' your last boyfriend do my last boyfriend was a philosophy student okay I was in college okay so in the future you want somebody who's equal to you um not going to be taller not going to be stronger no equal or I would say equal or higher um or higher yeah but it's just weird cuz I don't really view relationships in terms of higher or lower I usually view as who's going to help it sounds so weird I so I want to have children in the future I want to have three children um and I want somebody who's ideally good at the things I'm not good at you know cuz I want to be able to raise my children like equally what are those um so for example I um I suck at cooking I'm really bad at cooking you want your man to cook yes I would be the happiest woman alive if my man knows how to cook so you want to stay at home Dad um no not completely um so he would take over probably cooking I would probably take over more cleaning to even things out um we don't have to make the same exact salary I could make some more um or he could make some more but then I expect that to be reflected in the amount of like home labor that we take over so if he's making more I would do more home labor and if I'm making more I would expect him to do more home labor okay that's fair so now let me ask you this question yeah and you can go ahead and lie as much as you want I'm I'm I'm almost in fact I will bet you the milkshake that you lie to me right now I will bet you a milkshake that you lie do you think that most women prefer to have men who are have a higher status than them or they want it to be about equal no they want equal or higher I think they prefer higher um and I think the reason for this goes back to basic social conditioning right um not just social conditioning but I guess maybe this is a form of social conditioning um labor in the household so right now the problem that you have for a lot of women is that they're making either the same as a guy or in the scenarios where they're sometimes even making more but they're taking basically all of the household labor so it's like [ __ ] like let's say we're both you know let's say I'm in a relationship with somebody and we're making the same but now at home I am doing all the cooking all the cleaning I'm taking care of the children well [ __ ] now I'm doing basically twice a labor that you are I'm doing the labor in the home and I'm doing the labor outside the home it seems like it would be preferable to have like a man who could just hire all that out I think for a lot of women yeah I think for most people so higher status well yes but the point that based on social conditioning or is it just based on the fact that they want men to be able to provide the life they want yeah sure provision but I also think there's a lot of women out there who's not going to essentially go for a guy just because he has a lot of money um if they genuinely love a guy then they don't need the guy to be like freaking rich Mr Micky money pants um they just need the guy to be able to carry their weight yeah but the social status that you're talking about if you want to be desired by women the higher your social status is the higher you're usually desired by women yeah yeah for sure well then if that's the case then this commenter when he says M okay and by the way you do owe me the Burger but I don't owe you the milkshake cuz I feel like you were actually honest there then the commenter is correct that men have every incentive to climb the hierarchy because of female expectation that they do climb the hierarchy how would that be patriarchal um based on status if the status is demanded by women wouldn't women be imposing a matriarchy then no because I'm saying that women can demand whatever women they can demand whatever from their partner one it doesn't mean that the men are actually meeting that expectation and then two women themselves are not re reaching that status I'm talking out individually am I on the same level status as this other guy I'm not saying like what I demand of my partner I demand of the other person I'm saying like like from my merits alone can I reach that status yeah but men don't give a [ __ ] if you're Starbucks Barista and you're hot but I don't think that's true yeah true I think a lot of men care about beauty don't get me wrong I think uh do you okay so let's let's see if we can if we can figure this out in 5 seconds okay really really really [ __ ] ugly Rich chick really really hot Starbucks Barista 35-year-old guy go I think a lot of guys especially like now it would be Gigalo 100% now you definitely owe me the milkshake definitely owe me the milkshake lying through your teeth who would they take come on they're going to take the [ __ ] really heinous ugly millionaire over the Barista who's hot really yeah dude I think they would 100% And they treat on her too they treat on her Tri triangle um I think what is it I well whatever even if we disagree no I don't think we disagree so let's let's try this again um I just want just want to make sure that I'm crystal clear on this CU you're saying it publicly on a massive platform so I want to make sure I can clip this a th000 times and put distribute it everywhere I'm going to you think that if if a man an average 35-year-old Joe had the option right of being in a monogamous relationship with a hideous ugly unattractive as [ __ ] millionaire chick or a really [ __ ] hot 24-year-old Barista they would take the really hideous millionaire I don't think they would be monogamous I think they cheat on her okay but the they don't want you to cheat so yeah yeah so because of that you don't get you don't get the millionaire right I think what is it they would just they would 100% cheat on her I don't think that's the question though that's not the question I think most guys would [ __ ] the 24y old chick no which one would they want I don't I want to say I know I want to see the millionaire I do I think what is it it's cap being like oh no they won't cheat on them I think they will fine um I also think what they take the [ __ ] millionaire over the beautiful woman I get it they care that much about status no I think what is it it's just it's more about the stuff they can buy than the status and whatever do you think that it's wait can I do you think that um yeah you can ask whatever you want just I just have one quick followup right how is it possible for me to debate with somebody who's delusional like how how can I make delusional how can I craft a coherent argument if we can't agree on the basics Average Joe donated $100 I'll take the broke hot and an Americano of course of course who wouldn't take that I could take the broot should I do a poll in the chat did mention I'm pretty sure there was one time ask wicked wicked [ __ ] Witch of the West who's a millionaire with a hump on her back and she's gross as [ __ ] if she's the grossest person alive no not the grossest alive she's just really ugly yeah I think um so what's the what's the PLL question which would you pick really ugly chick but I know the two differences but what which would you pick which would you date which would you which would you pick for a monogamous relationship which which would you which would you date how about that how about which one would you marry okay sure which that's fine which would you date SL Mar all going to say the hot one so well I know but but you know they secretly though all of them secretly want the millionaire right I think what would happen if they ugly fat rich woman ugly fat rich woman versus ugly fat old rich woman versus young hot Starbucks take advantage of her wealth and then sleep with whatever young what they want that's what I think but if they could choose one yeah what is it I don't think yeah but if they could choose one you're saying if so without changing the question if they could choose one they would bang if they had to pick one to bang it would be the 24y old chick no if they had to pick one Mar day to Mary to live their entire life maybe I'm too female brained or whatever I would find it very hard um for so many men to just be like no like I actually would pick the 24 year old Barista they would well anyways and I'm not saying now I I don't want you to be confused by this I don't want you to think that I'm saying 51% would I don't want you to be confused and think that I'm saying 60% like 99 I I want you to understand that it would be 90 plus% of men who would pick the young hot Starbucks Barista and I would like to know from your worldview why you think that is other than because you would value the status of the millionaire I think guys like to think of themselves as oh and I shouldn't say guys in general cuz it's not in general I think there's a subsection of men who like to view themselves as you know Valiant like oh I'll protect her I'll take care of her blah blah blah blah they want fck they want to [ __ ] you know I just want to [ __ ] whatever no they want do you know why they want to [ __ ] young hot women do you know why they you're going to say because of the reproductive yeah what else would it be yeah I think um right now is to breed like what else would it be okay do you think looks is all that matters no of course not what else well I think it's situational so I think well so I think that it's conditional upon the situation of man that some things could change when it comes to that but I would always say this that primarily attraction does have to to be there and attraction not only does have to be there but it has to be there long term both people have to be attracted to each other or it won't work you can't falsify attraction so yet attraction is still going to be the number one edict do you think there are factors for men that influence attraction outside of physical appearance yes but not nearly as much so it's overwhelmingly going to be this one category first you couldn't have umbrella trains from it right mhm but the thing is is that I want to for the rest of my life want to be attracted to my wife why do these other factors influence oh for a variety of reasons because men have uh external preferences to just just singular things no no no but I'm saying what okay when it comes to physical attraction there is a basis right you're saying reproductive value is it fair that's why you value youth yeah yes is it fair to say that other factors are also influenc by reproductive value like basically outside of beauty ules the Pagan donated $100 I would marry the the hot Barista and then steal her tips see I can force an outliners toy anyway speaking uh speaking of which really quickly we do have the poll results in there's a pro I mean they're still coming in but there's over 900 votes which would you date Mary it's 93% hot 25-year-old minimum wage Woman versus uh it just shifted from to 92 8% say the ugly fat 35-year-old rich woman M yeah now it's back to 93 Focus okay so basically wait wait remember I told you earlier not 60% I know I know okay not 70% not 80 90 plus% of men would prefer this okay and these are probably trolls who are yeah voting for The she has an audience they've got to be offsetting it with that other 7% oh my audience is nothing I'm kidding go ahead anyways um those are just Andrew haters right go ahead do you think that basically the other factors outside of physical appearance are also influenced by the reproductive value they have I'm going to use intelligence intelligence as an example right um the whole idea why oh you know like I want to M I want to reproduce whatever so theoretically speaking a guy would value intelligence in a woman because it means that genetically don't value intelligence in women oh okay interesting is it enough to just reproduce for men yeah uh it's enough for most men yeah to be with a hot chick that's enough yeah no but what I'm saying is that um so I think that they don't want their women to like be knuckle dragging retards but uh when you're talking about hyper inell or high intell I think that you're talking about like um they want them to be really really smart right that's a that's like an attractive feature what I'm trying to say all kind of what I'm trying to say is that it's not I mean I think that they have to be able to like you know do basic things like cook and and clean I'm not sure that they need to be [ __ ] neurosurgeons no I don't think they care about that no yeah men care about not just their child only being born but their child surviving right otherwise that defeats entire purpose the child reprodu and dies 2 seconds later yeah okay so we agree it's not just enough for the child to be born the child has to survive and thrive cuz otherwise there's no point in reproduction it's they wow they're born and they die two seconds no okay so now that we've established that yeah but how hard is it to keep a kid alive literal [ __ ] retards can do this now what is it the question becomes and it's who what's going to be better for the kid to thrive a smart mom or a d thinking you're thinking way far past what men are thinking about yeah I don't think so like reproductively no you're thinking like a woman genetically you think you you're thinking maternally you select men based on the fact of how what is the longevity of our children going to be like men don't select you for that they don't need to okay reproductively speaking if it's not enough to just have your child be born your child has to thrive cuz otherwise there's no purpose of it being born if it's going to die and not actually be able to reproduce almost every woman can do this because it's not difficult to do okay do you want super not difficult to keep a baby alive in other words but it's not it's not just that right it's not just keeping the baby alive it's having the baby Thrive eventually so he can spread your lineage yeah but he thinks that the baby's going to thrive based on the abil his ability to produce not your ability to keep it alive they that's do any sense why because just reproducing as we established before is not enough if the baby is born and even if the baby meets a minimum standard of being alive that doesn't necessarily according to your view of like you know essentially like hierarchy um the baby has to be able to get climb or get higher in the higher gate so that they can then reproduce and continue the family in those terms you're wrong you're saying evolutionary we agreed evolutionarily that men want their children to thrive it's not enough for it to be born stop the mechanism for which that occurs we have two very distinct opinions about so let me explain I firmly 100% believe having raised many children into maturity that keeping a Child Alive is [ __ ] easy and it's even easy for a woman to do because they're designed to stay alive and so what happens is even 70 80 IQ dumbass women can keep a Child Alive men don't Bank on the fact never Bank on the fact that oh well you know when this baby is [ __ ] five or six what are the values she's going to in they don't think like that what they think instead is is the kid going to be healthy I can do all that [ __ ] [ __ ] I can instill the values I can instill the program I can instill all of that okay who What Child is going to be easier to install these values or programs in mhm an average well actually actually if the momart child actually if the mom is kind of stupid that would make it way easier for you to download your programming into the kid's brain because then what's the mom going to say gentics 5050 what's that genetics are 5050 yeah that's true okay Mike Davis $100 Andrew forget this debate for a minute I want to hear you speak on that fat Juice Head fake tough guy who tried to Alpha you on fresh and fit roast that Bozo well he apparently he just got swatted and he was caught on the the steps of some [ __ ] apartment or something crying his eyes out and that was all caught on film because he is a well I I mean like you said I guess he's the alpha of the alphas but anyway I don't endorse any of that by no uh no swatting ever that's that's gross but him crying that's funny yeah so if genetics are 50/50 MH then the mother's intelligence matters just as much as your intelligence yeah but this is a logical argument to preference I'm talking about what men prefer not whether or not it's logical yeah and I'm saying that they prefer that what is it I'm saying if you are arguing that men care about beauty because or F because that's linked to fertility and that's linked to your child surviving um they should not just should I I do think they do care about intelligence even though you're saying not this is why I don't think you're saying the truth because well I'll tell you the truth I'm going to be unequivocally as truthful as I can possibly be okay men don't give a [ __ ] about you being a doctor or lawyer or the potential to be a doctor lawyer cuz you have some big high IQ they don't [ __ ] care here's what they care about they care that you have a really nice and a nice pair of boobs and you look like you're going to Bear children and the reason they value the big boobs and the nice hip ratio and all of that is because intuitively they can see genetically been grained in them they know that you can bear their offspring so what happens is from The evolutionary standpoint right when they see you it makes their penis hard and they go I want to have sex with her and that's as far as they're usually thinking about it very simple question mhm you have a 25-year-old old um hot woman you have another 25-year-old hot woman equally hot um one is more intelligent than the other you're saying to you this uncore Bish uncore projecting donated $100 you said he'd exploit her plus cheat because that's at its core what women do to men it's her nature so you assume we are the same right ex seeth because it wins them better women evil [ __ ] boo smiley face smiley face face smiley face yeah so anyway you're thank go ahead yeah no you you were saying go ahead you're going to equalize the primary value the two 25 you have a 25-year-old hot woman and another 25 let me finish let me say the full sentence the answer is the intelligence you would select for the intelligence at that point okay yeah so if you had a 25-year-old hotwoman another one 25-year-old hot woman for intelligence yeah you would select for the intelligence yeah but why because because you've equalized the primary value so now now let me give you the counter to this cuz it's really simple now we don't have the equalizing of the primary value okay so the one chick is less hot and more smart and the other chick is less smart and more hot who does the man go for yeah I think it depends on how big cuz I'm pretty sure there's some guys who take a slightly less attractive woman who is going to guarantee that their child is basically going to be the next wait wait I'm basing it in the same exact hypothetical you gave me you said we're going to equalize the primary thing that men are interested in we equalized it one is more intelligent than the other I'm giving you the exact same hypothetical back with the only differentiation being okay now the primary edict here has been lopsided to the same degree that the intelligence was that's all I'm saying yeah so you're saying one is smart so however no however smart you in your conditional hypothetical or claiming the one woman is is exactly how less attractive she is in mine so which one is he selecting for yeah now you're reversing it so I'm not yeah no no no no I know what you're saying I know I understand what you're saying that's exactly what I'm doing so answer like I did so yeah a lot yeah a lot of men would pick the hotter one there you go but there's easily scenarios where you have a woman who is maybe slightly less attractive but super freaking smart and a woman who is you know more attractive less smart there's a lot of men who would pick SM men would take the [ __ ] ugly mil if you could guarantee or you know very high likelihood that your child is going to be the next Elon Musk uh-huh would you not take it if I had a crystal ball like let's say it's this woman is so intelligent and you know that yeah let's say but she was ugly not even ugly just slightly less attractive well no at that Casa in that case maybe I would equalize it that way but so really so if you had a woman who was hotter by the question you when you say slightly right that could mean like um I don't know her nose is in a slightly different position than what I would prefer right when you say slightly what does that mean yeah it means that we have two women uhhuh one's a little hotter but Dumber the other one is a little less hotter but a lot smarter yeah so if you if you if you would to take a secondary conditional like you were to say uh we could do this with money too oh this chick is her nose is in a slightly different position than I would ordinarily like but other than that she's just just as hot as this other chick but she has $2 million sure we can use that as an offset I'll absolutely bite that bullet because it doesn't do [ __ ] to my argument which is that when it comes to selection the primary edict is going to be the value of the looks and when you say that there's these uh tangential to this right that men select and value for I've already agreed that that's true but to a massively lesser degree than the primary edict in this case you have taken the tangential which have already agreed they value to a much lesser degree and put it at a massive higher degree than the slight amount of offset from them being hot because the point all you done is make my [ __ ] point for trying to illustrate triangle for you the point that I'm trying to illustrate here is that you said in the beginning the men don't give a [ __ ] about intelligence they just care if your hot but we have just Illustrated multiple examples where you said you know what the more intelligent one despite the hotness Factor so no what's happened is the the argument started and I can even show you in my notes with you saying that they value other things other than this and me agreeing that that is true they do value other things other than this but that the primary thing they value primary thing for instance you would agree with me that men would value a woman with 2 million bucks right yeah okay but when put to the poll of she does have that 2 million bucks but she's not [ __ ] hot they value the hot one over the 2 million bucks so we now have an order of operations of what they value we know that they value the looks over whatever this this tangential thing is that includes intelligence and this and that but if you were to make a tiny offset a slight offset to the primary edict here and you were to take one of these kinds of tangential and make it overwhelmingly high in order to take care of this tiny offset that I can literally concede to that and it makes my [ __ ] point okay I what keep going I'm helping them out it's okay sorry I got distracted sorry the point that I'm trying to illustrate as what I stated before well first of all I think yeah I do think most men are capping when they're talking about like the hotness of a woman versus multi-millionaires whatever prove it I think that's not what they marry what is it millionaires are marrying [ __ ] poor women millionaire women ain't Maring poor men okay sorry do you think what do you think the there's actors out there dating 20-year-old hot women who are not [ __ ] actresses but show me all of the famous millionaire women who are out there [ __ ] dating the Starbucks Barista who's a man JLo JLo what didn't she have like a young like 24 yeah is she married to him um probably not oh I just got a sorry I just fed physical engineering is a different Feld than applied engineering well sorry that was I'm let me go back to the main focus I agree most rich women well I don't know cuz you have cougars like we have a literal entire field we have a name for this of you know rich older women that go for younger men cougars aren't marrying them uh I donated this [ __ ] $200 just to get this dumb argument across please let the sink in men don't give a rat's ass about a woman's intelligence we just don't don't [ __ ] care like look the thing is is that when you when you if you make these uh value judgments I'm willing to concede to your value judgments I am willing to concede that men value all these different things they value intelligence they value um uh kindness uh there's a million different kind of like attributes that I would say men value what I'm saying is that the primary value that they they value more than any of those is the idea that you're [ __ ] hot that's what they value more than anything else more than any of those tangential now you can create offsets this so not true I'm sorry stop you can take create offsets where you say that I can slightly decrease the primary attribute to the point that it's almost who cares like nose in a slightly different position eyelashes a little longer than I'd like but I can compensate for that was she has $8 million or she's a [ __ ] 160 IQ neurosurgeon sure I'll ConEd to that who gives a [ __ ] um I want to go back to a couple of things you were saying oh you know these women aren't marrying like these younger men or whatever they're not um the vast majority are not but the vast majority of millionaire men are not marrying the 25-year-old Baristas either but far more of them are than the vast majority of people though if we're talking about you know society as a whole we're not just talking about out not just age range we're talking about class lines most wealthy people marry other wealthy people that's just how it be so the whole idea like oh look at these subsection of men that are marrying younger women that's not the vast majority though in the Avenue of what's pursued so that what this is a really interesting phenomenon which is that interestingly enough women's mate selection when we see what they're moving towards it seems to be a smaller section of men than it is for men towards women meaning that men seem to want a much larger pool of women than the opposite why would that be well it's because women desire a few different traits they want men who are taller than them of course men don't give a [ __ ] if women are taller than them or shorter than them they don't [ __ ] care women want generally for men to make slightly more money than they do or at least on par with the money they do men don't give a [ __ ] if they make as much money as they do right women prefer probably to have a mate who they think um you know can maybe fix cars or has a bunch of practical skills and things like this man again don't give a flying [ __ ] so what happens is the pool opens much wider for men because they're selecting for one primary thing over all others women aren't doing that yes will Women Marry unattractive men who have really high status or get together with them they do it all the [ __ ] time right men on the other hand are not going to settle down generally uh with a woman who's [ __ ] ugly as [ __ ] they're looking for some kind of woman who has some kind of beauty standard that's it as I stated before the reason why women are looking for people who have around like the same status as they do or hire is because women are still expected to take on the vast majority of Home labor and are you know basically unhappy with how uneven that system is they women do not want to be doing both home labor and out home labor they want to be able to either basically pick one or have it be around equal for both Partners how do you explain women saying then they're PR LOL paladins donated $100 she is also conflating intelligence with University brainwashing smart women are rare and nice a woman with a degree is actually a negative most women aren't neurosurgeons worthless STS but even if we were to Grant it l paladins even if we were just to kind of Grant her idea of this it it still wouldn't negate my point so who cares um but I mean it's a good point I'm just saying it doesn't negate mine either way as I said before about like home labor essential what was the question that you asked well so you were saying that the reason that women are selecting for this is because they don't want to do both the external uh work and have to do the home labor but the thing that's really interesting is that men are showing oh sorry I remember what you asked men are showing a consistent desire to have women stay home where they don't have to do any external labor and women are still shutting them down they say no that doesn't go in with my preference of having my own safety net and having my own career which is the thing that I desire not to stay at home so this argument that you are making right now no no no women would definitely hook up or end up marrying these guys if only they wouldn't make them work and stay at home is kind of mood because they don't want that yeah women basically want to be able to have their own career and have somebody who is willing to take 50% of the SS like they're demanding a higher status from men than men are demanding from or no they're demanding somebody to also take at home labor so when you look at like a lot of reasons why women divorced one of them is like basically like differences in in the household unsatisfaction what's the number one what's the number one reason they divorce irreconcilable differences yeah followed by problem but what do you think those irreconcilable differences usually when Pew researched dove into this it was really interesting because I had the same question what the [ __ ] what what does that mean irreconcilable differences the woman says I fell out of love he didn't give me the butterflies anymore why do you think that happened well when they dive into it they just say over time in many cases these women say there was nothing wrong with him he just didn't give me the Feeling Anymore yeah at least from what I've researched it seems like a lot of these women when it comes to especially households where the basically chy discrepancy is large and the women are still making around the same as a guy they start feeling that they're mothers essentially to their men they feel like oh you know here I am being like basically the same level of bread winner and now having to do the cleaning they're divorcing at the same rates even if the man is significantly making more money than them I am not certain about that I would have to see the what is it the exact study um well not only is it certain but I mean if you take the pool right here's the here's the% sure people with higher are less likely to divorce brackets they're less likely to be divorced because both of them are in a higher bracket so why you the that's interesting is that because you have the center class which is accounting for most marriages not the higher class or the lower class but the center class the lower class less likely to get divorced higher class more or I'm sorry more likely to get divorced higher class uh more likely to stay together but what about this massive Center this Center hole well when you look at the preferences and this massive Center which accommodating almost all of these marriages most of them in fact you find something really interesting which is that men their preference is will do a little more without okay and you can stay at home women say no [ __ ] that I don't want that I don't prefer that lifestyle I want to work okay so I want to split these chores with you and he's like no I don't want to split chores I want to work you do the chores at home they want a traditional marriage in other words women are saying no they're opting out of that so again if we go back back to your idea of status as being the symbol of patriarchy it appears to me that women are demanding that men reach such a status where they not only are earning the same amount okay or more but are also splitting the housework whereas men their idea equal status their idea of this is actually less no it's not equal it's a it's a privilege to stay at home it's not a privilege to [ __ ] privileg to have to do everybody's chores laundries no you have to do your own [ __ ] not that's why do you think if being a housewife is the easiest [ __ ] job on planet Earth don't ever try to [ __ ] me I've had one for years okay if this was the case job if this was the case why do [ __ ] rich people Outsource that labor if it's basically nothing what do you mean why not what because they're busy touring bus not glamorous they're busy touring is not what is it labor is not glamorous it's a Libor when you can Outsource it you do so nobody nobody's like wow I'm staying at home and I'm making the same amount of money this is so much fun obviously you're making more money you want the person to do the same level of labor I just want to make sure right if you're if you're trying to make the case that labor is labor and labor hard there people don't want to do labor sure I agree but you do way more [ __ ] labor having a job than being a stay-at-home mom what are you talking about that's where people would disagree who who would disagree okay let's go through I would say it's a different type of Labor I would say at least no no listen listen yeah let's get through it at least when it comes to labor in the house like outside the household I am guaranteeing a level of wealth for myself versus if I'm just doing internal household labor it becomes significantly harder for me to make my own business or to continue making money so so it means it's less stable it means I am now that's because you're doing less work yeah and I thought our whole issue is labor less work not just not not just less work which honestly contentious whatever yeah but let's start with that no no you are not jumping around money you're not making you can be you can have great you can paddle all you want wait till you're done paddling but you're not going to get away from question I can be I can be at home let's say I live in a pigy and I have to do 20 amount more labor than if I went out to work that doesn't matter it doesn't matter how hard the labor is at home because the point of the matter is I am not making money at home great so now let's get back to this idea first before I address Point 2 and three fre you always bring them up in fours cuz you Gish Gallop a lot let's just start with the first point can you explain to me how being a housewife can you walk me through your labor day go ahead walk me through the Labor Day you think a housewife goes through I'm basically cooking cleaning taking care of um well it depends on what type of household you're in but let's say for the very Basics very Essentials you're cooking cleaning and most likely taking care of children okay so let's say you have two kids at home yeah okay um one is five the other one is 10 okay uh walk me through your housewife day um I wake up I what is it probably early cuz I have to get the kids to school what time um either 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. okay so you wake up at 7:00 a.m. gotcha okay um I kids get on the bus right well no first I have to cook breakfast you don't have to cook breakfast I most most schools have free breakfast not that's definitely not true most schools definitely do not have free breakfast that's why they're trying to pass bills across the St okay but but even assuming that you give them a [ __ ] Go-Gurt and a bowl of cereal you give them a bowl ofal on their way out okay whatever I'm you're asking me my day as a housewife I'm telling you tell I cook breakfast um for them and husband um and what are you cooking for breakfast on an average day let's say I'm making you know eggs bacon pancakes typical American breakfast you're making that every day maybe not every day but how many days do you think a week you would make eggs and bacon and and sausage and toast for the kids um let's say two or three times oh you're going to make it three times okay three times okay so then what happens um then I have to get the children ready for school which means that I have to make sure that they put on like basically like oh get ready like put on your clothes 20 minutes we got 20 minutes they're brushing their teeth 20 minutes they have everything in their what is it that's more than 20 minutes by the way to get kids ready for school to make sure that they what is it lunch box has everything cuz I have to pack their lunch too you pack it the night before um okay well we can add those minutes of labor at the end anyways um what is it I also have to make sure that so you're up at 7:00 a.m. you've cooked breakfast eggs and bacon and sausage I'm going to give you a generous 30 minutes for that 20 minutes of getting them ready now they're at school okay now how long do you not have to take care of kids while they're at school they're you're going to say oh they're at school for 8 hours uhhuh so 8 hours of Labor gone well not no because in between that time I have to make sure I'm like cleaning everything make theoc how big is your house um let's say it's an average uh or this is not a whatever let's say it's a three-bedroom I'm well okay so how many square feet is a three-bedroom I don't know I can't think from Top my head okay so an average three bedro house I'll just give you the square footage here we'll say we're going to be really generous give you a nice big house house 3,000 square ft that's big oh big house that takes time also so hang on walk me through your three bedroom 3,000 squ foot house second I want to pause for one second I don't want to pause I want you to walk me through your day no no no because here's walk me through [Laughter] me I am walking you through the day good then finish walking me through your day but here's the deal okay here we go whatever offis it's not offc be just look at just look at the [ __ ] General market we know how much we value this labor because when we get we Outsource it to other people it costs 17 bucks an hour it costs more than 17 bucks an hour hour most I have a m service what are you talking about okay I don't want to be that person well whatever I grew up with a family that could afford that cost 17 bucks an hour they come once a week and do a deep clean takes them 3 hours to do a deep clean 17 an hour anyway so three bedroom 3,000 ft walk me through the rest of your [ __ ] day kids are gone what's the first thing you're going to do probably clean clean what breakfast okay so you clean breakfast that's going to take you what 15 minutes it's going to take me more I mean what is it that's 4 take the dishes you rinse them you put them in the [ __ ] dishwasher this is not rocket science it's not just what is at that it's also like crumbs in the floor vacuuming you know wiping down the table what are your [ __ ] kids animals I mean it doesn't your kids are [ __ ] they just take their plate and put their whole B in it or no I mean what is it what are you talking about like it's it's just basic right like that's not basic my kids don't [ __ ] stick their whole face in a plate SL around like the whole thing in the plate yeah it's no crumbs there's not [ __ ] all over the floor what are you talking about okay okay so anyway so you got but let's just say you pick up a few crumbs and this and that okay from your animal kids who you can't control cuz you're a bad mom so now we've got hang on so now we're uh what 30 minutes 30 minutes to clean up breakfast um maybe more whatever um okay how much how long does it take you to clean 30 minutes let's say 30 minutes I swear I could clean up a breakfast for six men in 30 minutes okay let's say 30 minutes whatever okay 30 minutes um what is it then I'd probably have to vacuum like clean down whatever the different rooms in the house make sure that the kids depends on how big the house is you said 3,00 000 ft yeah you got to vacuum the house oh plus laundry yeah what if you have hardwood floors like most you know sane people do when they have kids um I mean you still have to vacuum and wipe down mop um yeah so you mop so you're going to mop you're going to do this every day by the way You' probably do it um it depends on what what basically like every other day Okay well let's just use your most load heavy day so this day you're going to you're going to clean the house your most load heavy day you can think of yeah okay um so that would probably take me um I don't know it could take be like anywhere like two hours it's going take you two [ __ ] hours really if I'm doing all the rooms and if I'm doing what is it vacuuming you're going to deep clean every room in your house once a week I'm talking about like mopping and then talking about um vacuuming yeah it's going to take you 2 hours to vacuum your house a [ __ ] 3,000 square fet and Vacuum Plus mopping I'm putting both you're going to do this every day I'm not saying every day okay but on your labor intensive okay so we're going to add 2 hours now what okay um then I have to check what if there's enough food in the fridge if I have to go out to a supermarket or not like basically take into consideration that sorry I'm so so you you've taken into so now you need to go to the store and get something from the supermarket yeah I have to get food for everything okay so you have to get food so how long does that take you um I don't know most people take like an hour in the supermarket okay so we got an hour okay okay what else okay um then basically you get back home uh you do have free time now or you have some level of free time you either basically can like lay around wait mhm um so you're going to lay around and wait for how many hours so I mean we've got three so now I want you I want to tell you where you're at in your day so far okay this is what I have your day started oh take out the trash and and and this takes hours I'm sure no it doesn't take hours just another thing to add on to the list how long 2 minutes yeah B five minutes five minutes we just like be really generous here yeah okay so so far I I have the count at and I think this is very generous to you 4 hours of work and now you're lazing around your house okay so hang on at the by the time you're doing this I want to let you know your day started at 7: yeah okay uh so what do we got 8 9 9 10 so now it's 11:00 and you ain't doing [ __ ] okay the kids get out of school at what time um 3 330 they get out at 3:00 3:30 okay so we have so we have 4 hours of you not doing [ __ ] right now okay wait let me let's continue okay the kids get back home or you have to go pick up the kids right no you can have the school bus drop them off like every human being on planet Earth usually does but even assuming you have to go pick them up we'll generously add another 30 minutes School Bus Picks Them Up mhm unless of your kids are and unless of you're like bad mom basically AR I don't to say that cuz there's so many different whatever um your bad mom if the school bus drops off your kids no no no I'm about to say you're going to have to take them to extracurriculars unless if they have none so at 10: yeah what extracurricular is your kid going to be in theing Einstein program what extracurricular did you not have extracurriculars when you were 10 no okay what extracurriculars are there at 10 easy simple sports like volleyball or soccer or whatever you think I'm going you think that kids at 10 years old are out at their [ __ ] te what were you doing at 10 I was doing volleyball at 10: yes I'm not every day after school not every day but like how many days after school I think like twice or maybe three times okay so you got to pick the one kid up from school and then the other one probably has other different extracurricular activities you them both up yeah okay so now we've lzed around for 4 hours now you're doing work again you've gone and picked them both up that takes an hour now what now you have to drive them to their extracurriculars no no no you've picked them up from their extracurriculars well no okay you picked them up from school then you have to take them to their extracurriculars and then you have to be there you went to volleyball absent your school what do you mean didn't you just when you were done with school you had volleyball at the school right not always sometimes when you have like those groups or whatever they have practices like outside or they have that's [ __ ] rare they do it at school not all schools okay well what I didn't you're in a 3,000 ft house in the poorest community on planet Earth that doesn't do volleyball training at the school I literally what is it sometimes they do but sometimes they have outside training all right all right okay so we got another hour we're at 5 hours of of actual labor and four hours of lazing so give me the rest of the eight hours here in your labor intensive day okay so then include bringing them back from the extra extracurriculars okay so I'll add another hour there now we're at six hours um helping them with all their different homework okay so how long does that take you to do a 10-year-old's homework have you ever had yes I have have you I mean I've helped my younger cousin before okay how many how long um let's say it takes an hour not because 1 hour okay yeah so now we're at 7 hours of Labor yeah this is your most labor intensive day you better give me some more cuz we're only at 7 hours what else we got you've got dinner right um yeah definitely got to do dinner that's an hour so now at 8 hours right and now you have to clean after dinner now we have to clean after dinner so that's 30 minutes now we're at 8 and 1 half hours right yeah and now um what is it you have to pack their lunch for the next day you said include it at the end so that means I get to make lunch uhhuh um so what is that 30 minutes an hour hey sure we'll get 30 minutes okay so now we're at uh now we're at 9 hours and then um what is it none of this includes basically the stuff that you have to do outside of school for your children so whether it be or I guess extracurriculars kind of counts but that's like part of school but now I'm thinking like okay like being involved in like play dates being involved in um okay so now it's bedtime basically right okay yeah you have to get them ready for bedtime yeah get them ready to bed we got 30 minutes now we're at 9 and 1 half hours and then you go to bed after chilling for a while right so we got 9 and 1 half hours of labor on your most labor intensive day yeah can you walk me through your least labor intensive day and what that looks like okay yeah sure there's some days where all you have to do is cook and clean how many hours do you think in your least labor intensive days in my least labor intensive days um well no not just cook and clean bringing them in and out of school and extracurriculars but maybe they don't have extra okay least least labor intensive I'd say like 3 hours three hour days okay how many of those do you are you going to have a week [Music] um depends maybe three or four okay okay so we'll say uh just be conservative three and then on your kind of medium days we'd split it in say like 6 hours okay sure okay 6 hours and then that's not so now let's come up with our labor value here and to be clear this is not including basically setting up things like play dates for your kids going to other places or for the kids coming to your house um you know ideally if you can We'll add We'll add some of that on so let's say 3 days a week at 3 hours okay so now we're at 9 hours of Total work just on your lightest days 9 hours total then we're going to add in your heaviest day which is going to be another 9 hours we're at 18 okay that leaves us with the split of six at four so that's going to be um plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 did we we never included laundry yeah okay how how long for laundry you put it in the washer and you walk away from it well no because you also youing clothes and you're also having to strip the kids at 10 put their own clothes away didn't you teach your kids nothing um are your kids dumb they already are eating out of a trough you still have to do your family your what is it your husband and yours unless if you're giving your husband labor at home but assuming you're staying at home no um and you're also putting away so at a generous yeah very generous of Me by the way I'm going to give you in 7 Days 45 hours of Labor seven days okay so now let's go ahead and divide that okay at seven you're averaging 6 hours of Labor a day what do you think your husband's averaging of labor per day yeah you're going to say 9 to5 UM basically no no no he's supporting an entire family he ain't working 40 hours a [ __ ] week um no [ __ ] way he's working 40 hours a wecket 100% yeah okay the average income bracket this guy's pulling in at least 60 hours a week taking care of a family right I don't know honestly I don't okay well let's just give it 40 let's just give it 40 he's still doing 8 hours a day of Labor and way less of a labor window than you are 5 days versus 7 he's still working harder than you if we give you the maximum amount of Labor I can think of he's still working Harder Than You is he doing um what is it is he doing physical labor or is his job service any labor he's doing is harder than what you have described no I disagree um really vacuuming what like vacuuming and driving to get stuff from the store the difference and I'll tell maybe you can do your job in your pajamas literally so basically and there's been like a couple of studies on this anyways the N9 to five job oh thank God there's been studies yeah no you can laugh at me all you want the facts are facts um nobody actually works 9 to5 yeah well then I'm going to assume you don't actually work this amount of Labor either okay the point being is that seems like even though people go to the office 9 to5 let me finish my sentence seems it is the case that basically people do not actually work the entire time that they're at the office it seems like there's a maximum amount seems let me finish whatever well no I can't I can't I need you to commit to your positions not say seems I'm committing to the fact that people don't actually um work their entire 9 to5 there is a limit to how much human productivity can get in a day especially in an office why should we assume that the same is the case for the housewife the reason why we specifically labeled it different is because you're and this why I specified is it physical labor or not um because you are taking care of both you're going to you're I know you're going to laugh at me whatever the mental load and the sense of like oh trying to keep track of everybody's schedules trying to keep track of everybody has their things together trying to keep track of everything um you got to get your ass up before 10:00 in the morning the difference is you don't clock out you just had a 4-Hour window where you clocked the [ __ ] out not really on your busiest day 4 hours of doing nothing on your busiest day not really cuz you're still always respons you're sitting on the [ __ ] couch eating Bon bonss watching Oprah difference for always always always going to be responsible for what happens to your children so if something at school yes if you're if you're [ __ ] out and then you miss a [ __ ] message from the school saying hey we need you to pick up Jimmy he just like you know broke his [ __ ] arm you're the one who has to like which happens every once in a while well it doesn't matter if it happens once every once in a while the point that I'm trying to get across here is that your afternoon nap might get interrupted by having to go pick up Jimmy the okay you're not letting me finish well I'm sorry listen no you can make fun of me I've had I have a huge family I've raised a lot of kids I've got a housewife and let me tell you something it's not a hard [ __ ] job and the thing is is that here let me walk you through a real day of an average housewife not their coping [ __ ] [ __ ] day even giving you a 3,000 ft house you couldn't fill more than a 6-hour window of your day and that doesn't surprise me because here's what actually happens a cold lunch gets put in the fridge for the next [ __ ] day okay kid comes by in the morning eats a [ __ ] bowl of cereal grabs the bag lunch he's on the [ __ ] school bus and she doesn't do [ __ ] for hours that's most housewise cuz they don't have to because the nice thing about a house if it's maintained it's maintained so you don't have to clean it the reason it's maintained with a tiny amount of Labor so that you don't have to expand a large amount of Labor should we have Rachel uh do a call in real quick sure can you call her on the phone I would love I'd love to hear you tell Rachel about how hard a housewife's job is no because I'm not trying to play housewife [ __ ] Olympics what I'm trying to get across no it's very I mean you kind of are cuz you're you're extrapolating that the labor of a housewife is equal you let me finish my last like five sentences like holy [ __ ] go ahead the point that I'm trying get across is that when you are a housewife or Mom or whatever uhhuh you are basically constantly 24/7 responsible for your children and responsible like essentially for what your husband does at home um that is taxing that is exhausting it is a different type of labor than going to the office and not only that but it's a labor where you're not getting [ __ ] paid so no matter what at the end of the day you are put at a disadvantage so when I come home hang on so when I come home yeah make it fair so when I come home from the end of a day of the end of a workday and I hear honey the the drain is clogged the pipe is broke the [ __ ] door handle fell off a kid [ __ ] hit their elbow through the wall oh I need all this [ __ ] [ __ ] fixed oh and the car is making funny noises am I getting paid for any of that labor no but you're getting paid for the labor you do at the office no she's also getting paid for the labor I do now let me ask you a question is she eating off that labor sure she I'm yes sheit would she have to eat but the point is would she have to eat even on the merits of her own labor yeah sure okay so in both cases would she have to house herself in the merits of her own labor yes would she have to heat her house but so so the thing is is she's still getting all of the benefits of the labor just like I'm getting the benefits of the labor the difference is is that I still have to take on unpaid labor she's actually getting paid for her labor no the absolute difference is that no absolutely not there is an absolute difference here and it's that you ultimately do have control of the finances if you decide to quit or to leave the next day she is absolutely [ __ ] there's no way out of it think about what you're saying here you're saying that because the potential exists that the relationship may not work out that you need to create safeguards for yourself in the inevitable conclusion that it won't why would any man want to marry a woman in a million [ __ ] years who says I demand to have a safeguard for when this doesn't work out if women are the ones initiating most of the divorces it's what is it it's not even the worst case scenario if you die she's [ __ ] yeah but what about the net loss to the man think about it from a man's perspective of wait a second I just worked for 25 [ __ ] years and you spin up huge amounts of my wealth time and everything else you spent that and I had to spend it on you taking care of you you [ __ ] E taking care of your prod your children even if that's the case you are also taking care of your children she has an obligation to take care of her children she's taking care of their children more without she has that obligation just like you do take care of the children that is equally yolked but he conveniently you leave out wait I spent [ __ ] hundreds of thousands of dollars on [ __ ] you taking care of making sure that you had the heating and everything else in this big house that I would not ordinarily need and you got all of that that doesn't count [ __ ] compensate me what do you mean I'm saying that hey you know you can take care of her or whatever while she's taking care of the household labor sure whatever the point of the point of it is that if something happens to you she is now [ __ ] and I'm not even saying be malicious about it I'm saying let's say you get a heart attack so the point being is that she is essentially risking everything to just rely on you so is he she take him for everything in divorce court everything get alimony get half of his [ __ ] get the house get custody of the kids Let's find let's the exact percentage of alimony again she could get sorry do most divorces alimony stop no let's do it let's Google it you're not listening to the rest of it [ __ ] the alimony then we'll just say [ __ ] the alimon she can end up with half of everything she could get the house primarily get full custody of his children then who gives a [ __ ] his child support is supporting her even [ __ ] then and that is most of the ways that divorces go he's taking a greater risk than she is even if she's sitting her [ __ ] ass on at home because if she's unemployed the Court's going to award her or her child support from the man so he's going to support the child yeah but it goes to supporting her ass most of the time let's not kid ourselves I'm not kidding myself most of the time it is supposed to go to support the child supposed to go to that doesn't mean that's what it goes to also do what is it I I think you believe the courts enforce like child support more than they actually do like no I I definitely there's no way if you decide to run off in the middle of the night and go to a [ __ ] different state that she's going to even have the monetary or legal resources to hunt your ass down I'm sorry I do have to I do want to come in on this so a woman can just go to the Department of uh they got to be a neutral moderator here Brian we finish up yeah yeah be neutral I I like I like beating the tar out of people in debates but it has to be fair that's my rule so so back to this well it's just clarifying a point yeah but back to this right yes easily she can be awarded with all of this and often they are more often than not they're awarded with this especially if they have no income then the court looks at it and says the the children need to have some type of equal life in both homes so you need to compensate to make sure that they have that life over there there what is she losing here in fact she has an incentive to get divorced and go with a new man because now she cannot report his income taking care of her plus gets his I'm sorry most women who women yeah most women we can and we can search it up right now just Google it honestly um search up their economic status before and after divorce please how many of them are more financially off better being single mamas the vast majority are not better off that's just it like it doesn't so what so what so the fact is this picture that you're painting that women are like you know divorcing their husbands Pro to me that they're worse off when they're in their 30s and get a divorce than when they were married at 20 prove that to me prove that to me that at 30 they're worse off than when they were in 20 when they got married I think they're better off still they may not have had as good of a life as they had when they were married but they chose the [ __ ] divorce economically speaking economically speaking at 30 I guarantee you that they're doing a lot better than were at 20 even if they're [ __ ] divorced so that argument is moot it mean means nothing it doesn't even make sense you're saying what is it compare well first of all I don't think anybody's doing very well if they're getting married in their 20s generally speaking um right huh yeah yeah no agreed so what is it I'm 99% sure and we can like find out right now um most women end up yeah they end up in a lower socioeconomic bracket after they divorce than before they divorce but that doesn't mean that they're socioeconomic bracket still isn't higher than it would have ordinarily have been had they not been married yeah I don't think that's true prove it let's find out like can we google right now honestly prove that they leave at that prove it prove that they go into the marriage at a higher socioeconomic status than when they leave I would love to see that demonstrated about this while she's looking that up we do have a super chat Paul Jame she she sounds so wild you sound like the vice I can imagine can be an un wait what oh the vice president I can imagine can be wait an unburden what has been but can be unburdened by what has been but there are those still unburdened word uh Paul Jame thank you for the Super Chat man really appreciate it thank you even though I didn't really understand it I Still apprec Still appreciate it thank you man and then we do have I'm going to let these uh there's some ttss that were yeah we got to wrap the debate anyway yeah we're going to wrap up here soon guys if you want the TTS has been dropped to $69 unless you guys want to do a 10-minute roast session little do the 10-minute rast okay we'll do the little one more thing then we can go to R session you're saying before marriage and after marriage hold on just let these come through real quick 69 donating $69 69 hi Andrew how are you today man good hey pixie I'm boor I was wondering do you want to Daily Talk on Instagram and get helpful texts by me I give you 69 o34 uh Pixie did you hear that what did you say uh something do you want to talk on Instagram with this guy just Gerald donated $69 hey Gerald good to see running whe barrels of concrete for 12 hours was difficult well put Gerald sorry that it it took us a little while to get to these they came in about 15 minutes ago I just wanted to pause it to allow the uh conversation to flow Gerald thank you for the TTS much appreciated pixie any response to 69 wants to talk daily on Instagram yes or no uh-uh need a yes or no no okay just once a week then J Gerald donated $100 and I thought running wheel barrels of concrete for 12 hours was rough there it is again Gerald thank you for the TTS appreciate it yeah listen listen oh wow it's not okay housework 6 hours of it per day on your heaviest day is you and your [ __ ] stupid concrete bro you need you know what dude why don't you just stop being such a little [ __ ] go do some housework for 6 hours a day on your heaviest day that will teach you the value of real work sir that is the value of real work ulyses the Pagan donated $69 I'm machinist at a heat treatment PL working 12h hour shifts 5 days a week and overtime my wife is stay at home happy and has a beer ready for me she's not servient just grateful and I heard yeah but dude okay listen ysus you're [ __ ] ridic ridiculous okay just because you work way more than 40 hours a week like every other [ __ ] workingclass man who has a family that I'm aware of at the moment doesn't mean that your contribution is nearly as much as it is from 6 hours of daily housework why don't you get your [ __ ] together bro get your [ __ ] [ __ ] together what the hell is wrong with you oh last thing the poll I think it we ended it it had about 2 200 votes it was 91 to 9% or sorry 91 to 9% bias very very I mean it's sample selection of men I'm sure that all of them are lying about their preferences I'm not even going to get into sample selection but I do want to mention um when you were earlier stating oh you have to compare it before marriage versus after marriage you also have to compare it to what would the woman have been making if she did not stay at home yeah but that's a subjective metric that's not a subjective metric it is so the thing is these chicks are getting married at as [ __ ] Baristas and then they go but I had a dream to be an astronaut it doesn't mean [ __ ] the vast majority are getting married within like essentially their socioeconomic most of them are getting married at [ __ ] 30 and have hopped between 20 [ __ ] jobs in their life are you [ __ ] kidding me are most people wait most people get married in their 30s okay yes thought you said most people I thought you were saying like and guess what they've jumped 20 [ __ ] jobs before they got married usually most of them don't even have stable [ __ ] linear careers so what are you talking about they're still making cash versus if they just stayed at home yeah but you said is that hard to understand because that cash offset they would be spending it anyway and in this case the man is taking care of that same cash they would have been spending we're saying they would be making more cash and prove it prove it prove that they would have been prove that the [ __ ] Barista would have been making more cash than the [ __ ] machinist okay you all you have to do is like literally compare women who decide to stay at home versus women who just continue to get a career and then also have children yes but you're not offsetting it with what they normally would have to spend on themselves so what I'm saying is is that it's great hous my no yes yes yes so if you're a barista okay and you're pulling in I don't know 14 bucks an hour or something like this you agree with me that you have to pay your living expenses okay stop yeah I I I'm not disagreeing with I'm going to walk you through it and then I'll go through your [ __ ] okay but you can't spur and just go I don't want to talk about this so uh you agree that they're going to have to pay the living expenses their heating cost their car care cost their gasoline they're going to have to pay for all of that [ __ ] right sure all of it how much money do you think that the average [ __ ] woman has in her savings account after she pays her own expenses tell me almost none of them have any almost none of them have a savings account at all so if that is the case that most women don't even [ __ ] have a savings account cuz they don't cuz they don't neither do most men most Americans are living payche payche guess what that's very helpful to my argument and not yours if most people don't have a savings account then that means that they're spending all of that money on just living expenses and the expenses of being [ __ ] alive so if that is the case then if the man is taking care of her this entire time all of her living expenses the things she would have been spending that other money on without the savings account are being accommodated what point of it's her money that you don't understand it's it's still her money they're married no it's not because when it's a guy again as we've stated before if something happens to him or if something malicious happens to him she is then monetarily [ __ ] yeah so would he be no he'd be a lot less [ __ ] he's has if she divorces him takes half his [ __ ] again as we've stated before most of these women after the divorce are in a lower socioeconomic bracket so she's not maintaining no let me finish let me finish that's off you're ausca the point absolutely 100% you got to do the L thing when you do that you are you are Aus skating the point the point yes the point is that if they are what is it giving up their ability to work for the past 10 years and now they're in a worse economic social position because of the divorce socieconomic position yeah they're not going to be able to continue that same lifestyle as before versus if they contined to work and then you know got divorced okay now they're still around the same level they still have that same experience they are not relying just on you know child they they hopped from 10 jobs to they would have hopped to 20 jobs and still not had a savings account and still not they would have still be able to be in the workforce they don't lose that they still could be in the workforce they go back it's going to be you okay I don't know in what reality you live in where an employer looks at a 10 year gap on a resume and says you know what you should get paid just as much as this person who worked 10 years this is an unfortunate argument that you and progressives make all the time but an employer would actually rather look at a 10year gap in employment history than see that you job hopped [ __ ] nine times in the last 10 years true I'm sorry no look at the number one to ra way to raise Sal look at the number one way to raise salaries I'm sorry it's job hopping why people do it guess what that is true AB not prefer employers because employers need bodies and so when you need bodies you don't have a labor force which can accommodate bodies you'll hire [ __ ] anybody regardless of their work history salary let me finish I just let you go through your Spiel okay okay so again if you have a labor shortage sure you can do all the job hopping you want cuz people are so desperate for bodies but the same would be true for a woman who hadn't worked for 10 years as it would be for a woman who job hops every 6 months do you think an employer for instance likes to look at your resume and see that in 6 months the chances that you're going to leave the company are almost 100% probably not same thing they look on the other hand and see oh 10e age or 10e Gap in employment history cuz I was a stay-at home mom they would probably prefer that yes absolutely not what they look at is oh you're a hot commodity or whatever look at your experience we want to take you away from your comp not even in the same Fields when you said the job hopping when you said job hopping usually you make the high no they don't yes they do okay most people are not going from astrophysics to Thea or the other way around well most people aren't going to astrophysics nothing but the biggest increase in salary from job hopping is when you switch careers careers switching and changing number one indicator for making a lot more money care within the same bracket going from what is it doing yeah as I stated before [ __ ] astrophysics to law what usually happens is maybe I start as a [ __ ] paralal whatever get my law degree and then I technically switch jobs into an attorney people yeah okay either either way here's common here's what's common okay you're right you know what you're right you're not going to jump most people are not going from teacher to you're you know what you're not going to jump from your [ __ ] entrylevel ass position at the Arby's to the entry ass position at the In-N-Out right both of those positions one pays in and out let's say 20 bucks an hour and your [ __ ] Arby's job paid $9 50 cents an hour I guess technically you're in the same field but the truth is is it's a mass career change cuz everything you're doing within that job capacity totally [ __ ] different than anything you did but the other thing is is when you're talking about Fields if you're just talking about sales for instance okay is sales dynamically going to change you think in the 10 years that you're a housewife is is the mechanism for sales going to change if you could sell H uh houses or you could sell cars or you could sell any of those things before could you just not suddenly do that now it's just not within your purview if I'm going to hire someone I'm going to obviously hire somebody who has more experience in sales than somebody who doesn't even if they job hopped 6 months ago it means that that's a really stupid why would you want an most people are most people don't want to take somebody who labor force for 10 years when there wasn't a labor shortage the number one indicator that you weren't going to be employed was job hopping number one indicator search find it I'm curious you can pull it up cuz I'd be surprised if it wasn't previous unemployment look under the Obama era especially when you had a a huge lack of jobs number one indicator you weren't going to get employed job hopping do you guys you want to look that up I'll let some ttss come through how about that the blind Archer donated $69 women have 44% less save

donated $69 see you presented yourself well even if I disagree with a lot of what you speak on debates like this are needed good on both of you enjoyed it will C be doing verbal combat course she needs it but the big the big thing the big thing is is um just don't scream as much it hurts my face just don't scream as much sorry it's the Hispanic in me it's the one stereotype I can adhere to

ideology ggwp West all right Leo thank you for the TTS there uh appreci ju toose 03 donated $69 pixie feel the room closing in on you that's the feeling of getting cornered ideologically by your own circular logic by the way how many injuries do stay at home moms get God bless Andrew it's pretty rough pretty rough for them single stay-at home or for them stay-at-home moms and injury Department sometimes as they get their ass off the couch and they're moving over towards the fridge they trip snub their toe it's a rough life Optimus Prime girl donated $33 housework doesn't have to be hard or a burden in order to be important you're making a point against yourself working moms could never do this if it was that hard pixie no Echo today no Echo don't know sorry thought you might you might you might have thought that that was a point for you but actually was dunking on you slightly he was saying you know Andrew you're being too charitable by saying that this is even valuable labor to begin with if it was actually difficult women wouldn't even be able to [ __ ] do it that's what he's actually saying that was very cleverly worded by the way very cleverly worded if you guys want you can get in your final uh TTS messages before we wrap up here I'm just going to pause it temporarily to allow uh Pixie and Andrew to make their closing statements so if you guys would like go ahead make your closing statements why we have pixie go first and then well she went she went first so usually usually the person who goes first goes last right to be like maximum Fair sure sure Brian's still learning how to do the debate thing I'm still still learning all right Andrew why don't you uh start with your close uh so first thank you for coming in I really appreciate it and in the spirit good sportsmanship across the table I appreciate it very much um there was a chick whose hand I wouldn't shake yesterday so I made sure to shake your hand because I'm I was afraid I'd get the same outcome if I didn't so anyway so back to the closing statement we went all over the place this debate we we started with um uh epistemology and foundations of ontology and um it went all over the place when it came to feminism but I did appreciate the spirited argument back and forth it was a lot of fun for me because I don't get to do it as much as I used to uh especially with you twitch poll nerds because uh you guys are fun uh to argue with a couple of points of contention that we had don't think you demonstrated in any way shape or form that feminism is good your definition of patriarchy really sucked when it came to status because I was able to demonstrate that women have tons of statuses that men do not and if the case was in the power Dynamic I was able to demonstrate that women have much more power in some of these Dynamics than men do so I don't think that that was a really good point for you to make and I thought that got blown out pretty hard I thought on the stay-at-home mom you made the uh valid point of what happens to women though if the marriage goes goes south right what is your answer to this I thought that that was a much better portion of the verbal sparring and that your points were a lot more solid there but going back circling back to the forc doctrine of men and women completely wrecked there [ __ ] insane take to say in any way shape or form that you would invest your life savings in female prison guards nobody you're going to [ __ ] believe you including you no [ __ ] way even if we gave them more accuracy and quicker trigger fingers you would put everything on men every [ __ ] time and I wouldn't blame you neither would anybody else Force Doctrine does exist you're example of force Doctrine also sucked from the A to B to C guy and the reason was is because there was still implicit Force there so we never were able to demonstrate that women could ever really grasp Force Doctrine away from men um so just like a lot of your arguments I would probably Shore them up but I thought he did pretty good on the last round right I thought that that was some pretty good jousting rest of the debate ah not not not not not the greatest points I ever heard but I do appreciate you being a very spirited interlocutor so I'll just yield with that pixie also God is real and Christ is God I just wanted to let you know so obviously we disagreed on a lot of stuff um I still don't agree with how you view power in society although there is explicit Force I still think that a lot of it is done in ways that are not just Brute Force um a lot of power in society is wielded through essentially social contracts or through indirect Force essentially um and can be done by just essentially private contracts to a level um I appreciated our conversation overall I think um what is it yeah I'm trying to think about specifics but honestly I'm just very very hungry right now so it's hard and you owe us in and out I do not think I owe you Inn out but I am going to get pizza afterwards and we'll treat you guys to slice if you want um slice yes a slice a singular singular slice it'll be a sad slice too I'm going to pick the sadest you [ __ ] eat one slice of pizza also you can't get a salad at the pizza place well you can it's just like it's just a whole tomato with lettuce though no have you seen that Family Guy yeah totally it's exactly like of lettuce tomato what's your closing go you got to finish your closing um but yeah I appreciated the conversation I do think you made good points I am very tired um but thank you so much for being here for being a good sport um and for making this a fun time cuz I had glad you glad you had a good time all right great we'll allow those I just got a feeling we're going to end up covering dinner though I just know it I just [ __ ] know it it's female privilege Brian thank you all uh all of you out there and the whatever podcast I know we weren't able to restream to The

have known that there you go D thank you man BB donated $30 appreciate Andrew based on your worldview you are saying that the Christian God are real because that is just what you believe to be objective truth how does someone as logical as yourself believe that L it's like he didn't even hear what I said in my intro what I said was that the ability to have an a uniring meaning knowledge itself I believe that the necessary precondition to even have knowledge is that you have something you can appeal to which is unchanging that is the argument the philosophical proof for God which by the way if you noticed what pixie said where she was like but I have knowledge of all of these things because of my subject even the box that she put herself in and said do you agree that I have knowledge inside of this box even that is a knowledge claim right the precondition for us to even have a conversation is based around the the idea that we can know something from a standard which is unchanging subjectivists can't how can you even have coherent conversations with them if they can give you no standard from which is unchanging for us to even make knowledge claims it makes no sense to me that is logic it's called the transcendental argument for God learn it okay let me see if there's any others coming through we are going to do a quick twitch raid here let me get that going real quick we will do a raid on Bob C we're not going to pull it up though all right uh I think that's it for all the uh all the chats guys uh but thank you for the Super Chat by the way yeah guys thank

meet you today man uh all right I think we're all caught up uh let me just do my little outro here one sec guys okay GG well played to uh the panel say so NZ donated $30 WTF the laws of nature are unchanging and fixed zero evidence for God or why that would be any standard of logic there are so many gods and none have any evidence quick response until wild donated $30 pixie how old are you and why haven't you found a husband by now going to have your first kid at 33 pixie I'll have you answer that then Andrew can answer the previous one God um I'm 25 and I don't want to get married until I am closer to 30 for a couple of reasons I also don't want to get divorced um one kid you can have one kid I want three kid going have one kid to get married thir I have most of my family got married around that time and has had multiple children so we'll see what happens most of your family got married at 30 and had multiple children absolutely how many members of your family are we talking here I have um like 14 first cousins most of my uncles and aunts got married like around 30 and have had like three children I'm not joking yeah I did I just okay and then there's the one that came in right before that Andrew I don't know if you had something quick on that one which one was it uh zero evidence for God oh there there are so many gods said there's so many gods I know but the the concession is just that the prerequisite for knowledge would require a God we just start there before we get into the rest of it Dylan Hefner donated $30 Andrew was the goat the br/ Andrew Duo added again Ask pixie would you rather be alone in the woods with a bear or with Andrew pixie you were way better than the psycho last night way better yeah how was the psycho is she just yelling she was a
