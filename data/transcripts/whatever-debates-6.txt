fastest debate growing debate channel to my knowledge anywhere on YouTube um I'm a a political satirist I do political commentary and I also do blood sport debates my name is Renee um I'm currently a seconde student at UC Santa Barbara and I'm a political science major all right welcome to the both of you good to have you back in studio thank you for coming appreciate it thank you for having me yeah and uh we did have you on the dating talk was it on Sunday yes was it okay and that was a uh that was I think that was one of our best shows that we've had you on Andrew that was a good show it was a very good show can't say the same about uh last one the last one but we're not going to get into that but um got a lot of positive feedback on that show though the last one okay so I think a good place to start off with for this conversation you guys did tend to disagree quite a bit during the uh dating Talk podcast so I think we ought to start start there um um what do you guys disagree on would you like to start well let's let's start with what informs your worldview okay what informs my worldview yeah so if you're if you're doing a debate a debate is going to be informed in your positions by what the worldview is the prism in which you're looking through so that this would be the eyeglasses as you're zooming in on in order to see the world so for you you know maybe it's um a utility I'm just throwing these out by the way maybe it's a utilitarian framework or maybe it's a religious framework or maybe it's uh you know you see everything through a secular framework or you know there there's all sorts of different worldviews which can be applied I just wanted to kind of see what yours might be I'd say I hold multiple overlapping worldviews at once um can I ask you the same question yeah but let's what's what's your worldview and I'll I'll get into mine right after you um I don't really think I can give a comprehensive statement on my full worldview I'd say um based on the terms that you were throwing around um I wouldn't classify myself exactly as this but I'd say I generally do prioritize utilitarianism or maximized utility for all the people in a society and does that operate off of a harm principle yes okay and so harm is utility so if you're using the harm principle uh just real quick can you just tell me what kind of like generally consider harm the harm principle dictates that um you the government should only prevent people from doing something if it is going to inflict physical harm on another person that's Mill John Stewart Mills harm principle yeah but I mean so that's Mill but I mean Bentham also was part of utilitarianism so Bentham had a hedonic calculator and so what he would do is he would say you know x amount of harm uh based on uh not maximizing pleasure so another way of saying it' be like maybe suffering if you're not maximizing pleasure then that's some form of suffering so I'm just I just want to get you know the specifics out yeah but I I'm I wouldn't you're you're pointing me towards Hedonism right kind of sort of I wouldn't say that I prescribe particularly um bentham's um idea of the harm principle okay it's more so just Mills and I wouldn't even say I fully agree with um the harm principle being used as the only um like uh backing for laws but okay I I think as it stands today that's like generally accepted especially in the American conception of Rights harm yeah harm principle I think leads a lot of it okay and so so you're specifically talking about governing and you're saying from this perspective government can only do things which stop physical harm from being perpetrated on somebody else no I didn't say that um they can they can do a lot of other things I was saying usually when it comes to conceptualizing laws rights Liberties Etc whatever you want to call them um it's on the basis not of um how much you're helping someone it's on the basis of whether or not you're going to harm someone physically and if your action can harm someone physically then it will be it uh they'll enforce the law upon you so how does this differ from utilitarian or libertarianism with like the non-aggression principle the non-aggression principle I'm not familiar so it's uh just saying that uh your rights end where you could possibly be doing something bad to some else are infringing on their rights uh I I don't have a full knowledge on that but just like you can't let me see if I can frame this better um so the non-aggression principle would be nobody has the right to be aggressive to anybody else okay they they can't aggress in a physical way okay or interject themselves in a physical way and if they do then you can respond in a defensive manner but you're not allowed to aggress and so it just sounds like when we're saying harm physical harm when you're talking about governing it kind of sounds like a a non-aggression style principle I I thought that it was I thought that I was under the impression it was the same thing basically the two things you just described non-aggression well they're an opposition they're an opposition to each other because harm can be defined external just harms or or physical harm so for instance um you can have policy discrimin atory policy where there's no physical harm in Mill's conception he only is referring to physical harm I believe okay no I get it but this is I was just explaining the difference between the non-aggression principle being in opposition to utilitarianism that's all so I was just asking just asking if they sound similar to you or or what so you see your worldview is utilitarian and harm um yeah I'd also say um I'm rather individual IND idual istic on priorities on like Enlightenment ideals individual Choice kind of thing okay so John Lock stuff um in the context of the the discussion regarding gender yes all right cool all right so my worldview is nothing nothing nothing oh my worldview is Christian ethics and my political persuasion would be something that would be akin to Christian populism sometimes this is referred to by the left as Christian nationalism but there's a lot of conflation so um Christian nationalism can mean a hundred different things Okay Christian populism just is stating emphatically that there needs to be some kind of grounding morality for the governed and that that can't operate within a secular framework very well and so you appear appeal to something which is arbit and ends up being far too individualistic so essentially that would be the summarization of the position okay do you have like any questions that you want to ask on that so you get the worldview down um let's see so that uh what distinguishes your view from Christian fundamentalism well I'm not sure what Christian fundamentalism is uh oh well I guess I'm I'm not too sure either I mean like uh that generally just like maybe I'm incorrect about what it is but what I thought it was was like um basically just the belief that the government should be completely ruled on the basis of uh scripture No that's so the Orthodox belief belief that my worldview ascribes to is that there should be what's called Symphonia or a Synergy between the church and the state meaning that the secularist you would believe in a line dividing the church in the state church is over there doing its thing States over here doing its thing their separate entities Symphonia would say that it's just fine to have religion in for politics um and in fact we probably should have religion in for politics and that having Church churches involved politically is not a bad thing at all how do you decide which church informs politics well whether we would make the distinction of which specific Church let's just say I want it to be the Orthodox church or they want it to be this church the fundamental question starts with should any church or should a collection of churches or should there be or should there be allowed to be any kind of religious Foundation when it comes to governing and I don't see a big problem with it you don't see a problem with religious foundations for governing governing what what what about when different religious groups are within one nation what about when different secular groups are um I mean which religion would the whole state ascribe to which secular belief does the whole state subscribe to uh it's based on a democratic process of voting I mean it's not a but there's secular interest groups right so all of them are vying for power they're still secularists and they all have different beliefs maybe some believe in secular humanism maybe some believe in you know some other form of uh you know maybe Satanism which is a secular belief there's all sorts of different secular beliefs which exist that people can ascribe to can one hold multiple secular beliefs with different interest groups sure can one hold multiple religious beliefs Beyond different religions yeah across different religions sure all right can one do that sure should one do that I'm not so sure that's a different question all right so yeah so anyway so that's my position uh but maybe we can start with the idea cuz this was an easy one that you threw out there of gender and we can compete and I think you'll get a better feel for my worldview of me for yours based on that conversation so you're talking about trans rights things like that what do you stand there trans rights oh that's an interesting one to jump in first um I don't avoid that oh okay we're staying away from that yeah okay uh can we talk about gender at all or no we can I mean we can just I guess stay clear of it um oh I I want to talk about gender um see I was going to ask you what the basis of your distinction between the fundamental differences of men and women women are besides physicality you mean besides bio biological yeah they're ontological uh biological yeah besides biological so you said besides physicality right yes so yeah so I would appeal to ontology say there's an ontological distinction between men and women and a biological distinction between men and women can you describe that ontological distinction yeah so ontology is just like being right it's just the state of being what is being what is you know what is that and um I would say that when you especially when you're looking at reproduction and when you're looking at the different ways that women behave regardless of the Societies in which they're in that there is definitely a thing which makes a woman a woman distinctly from a man so they're not interchangeable widgets in other words that's how I would view it okay so um what what makes you believe that one of those is more fit to lead than the other okay well that's a conflation of gender of gender versus sex but if you're talking about what makes you think men should be able to lead over women what what do you think personally makes them more capable of leading than a woman well it's not even capability though that would come into it it's comes down to a matter of force so men have a monopoly on Force so they can take away rights and they can give rights but women can't take away rights and women can't give rights only men can do that and you're saying the Monopoly force is based purely on physicality and biology well yeah I mean when you're talking about you mean physical attributes yes yeah yeah so yes men are far stronger have larger skeletons etc etc so essentially they're the dominant sex for that reason have you ever met a female police officer sure would you say that she has the same ability to enforce the law as a male police officer no why not not they both have guns wouldn't you say a gun is an equalizer sometimes unless the man also has a gun and then it's unequal again so the problem is is um even then you still run into other problems too which is um when men can apply physical Force up close in personal guns become useless and we see this all the time when male police officers end up in engagements with women and men they seem to be able to handle those engagements fairly well those sometimes are overpowered by Men Women on the other hand have a much harder time handling physical engagements and they can't always just move right to their to their gun right they're supposed to control a situation external that that's the last resort you don't want to go straight for the straight for the handgun but unfortunately they can be surprised very quickly so even during a traffic stop something like this they don't have nearly the ability to defend themselves that men do for sure and the standards get lowered in fact so that they can even get a job as a as a cop so oh interesting take there um the first thing I noticed you said was that a man with a gun and a woman with a gun would not be equal that's correct um personally I would say that I disagree with that because it's about the maximum amount of force they can exert at each other if they're both standing a foot away from each other and the most powerful thing they can do is shoot the gun then they both have the same maximum amount of power You could argue that a man is more physically capable when if they're hand-to-hand combat thing but you could also argue okay what about a 55 100 PB man with a gun next to a 6ot 200lb woman with a gun have you ever used a handgun um no but asked you a question yeah no but and I'm going to answer it I promise have you ever used a rifle no I've never used any kind of gun no okay they're complex machines and they require physical strength to use well they're not it's not like the movies where you just point it a direction you pull the trigger and the bullet magically hits the target uh guy is diving on the table and he's doing this number you know what I mean he's spinning around with the handguns pulling the trigger and everybody's dying that doesn't map on to reality guns use blowback and they're not easy to wield not for for men competently or women takes practice but men are much better able to control recoil they're much better able to control the actions on guns they're much better able ble to reload their physical strength means a great deal even an action reloading speed it means a great deal so they're still at an advantage even if you're both armed so do you think women deserve a right to own a gun yeah you just expressed to me that you believe women would women would be more incompetent as compared to a man when it comes to learning how to expertly handle a gun so wouldn't you see that as like a safety concern or no okay okay would there not also be discrepancies among among men though comparing one man to another too yeah okay yeah but I mean I just I don't really understand which is why his point doesn't make any sense at all because he just admitted that anyone can be bad at using a gun or good at using a gun yeah we're just talking about averages so if you're if you're physically stronger and somebody's physically weaker you're going to be more prone to be able to use a gun well than the person who's physically weaker that's just the truth okay it requires physical strength to utilize it it's like think of it like um it's not a direct one to one but it'd be like wielding a sledgehammer would you say somebody who's stronger would be probably better than somebody who's weaker willing a sledgehammer even though that's not always going to be the case that one is pulling a trigger and receiving the push back and one of them is actually wielding with force behind it well not one is loading a spring loaded magazine that has significant amounts of pressure behind it it's under pressure because it has a spring my you're dealing with a gas operated blowback weapon so not only are you dealing with the recoil but you also have to realign your shots and you have to do uh all of this within a matter of seconds reloading same thing when it comes to muscle memory and it I mean physical strength for rifles even is a massive deal just clearing a jam inside of a a gas operated weapon can require significant strength because you can have shell expansion so it's just like over and over physical strength definitely matters and it also matters to how much ammunition you can carry okay so if there's a bunch of shorter weaker men what is stopping the military from conscripting taller stronger women who would like play for the WNBA or something they could then you just prove that women can enforce rights as well no then well you would still end up with men enforcing rights it would be men who would enable those women to go after those short dorky weak men or whatever well how are the men enabling the women if the women can also bring up arms how you said the men are enabling them to use the guns yeah well men build all the guns and the military is staffed by men who run it so those men would be enabling those women to then get armed and be huge and whatever they already did that when they invented guns no they didn't do that inventing guns didn't create an inst an equalizer between men and women with Force because both men and women can use guns and men use them better than women your argument for why men deserve more rights than women is because men can use guns better than women can when did I argue that uh correct me if I'm wrong then yeah you're wrong I didn't argue that wasn't my argument alter what I just said to fit your argument so what happened was and this what I got in my notes you said but can't women just use guns as an equalization to force and then I went into the reasons why that's not actually Force Equalization how on Earth you attributed that to that's my argument for why men should have the right to vote and women shouldn't I have no idea I don't know where you came up with that oh sorry I was kind of assuming based off of the last podcast what would you say then is the reason why well let's stay away from the right to vote for for now okay we'll come back to it for reasons right that we discuss we'll come back to it um and let's instead just look at Force Equalization okay meaning who enforces whom's rights do you think that it's equal between men and women rights enforcement um I don't think men or women um enforce rights I think institutions enforce rights well so men and women give away or they concede things to allow that Institution to have power over them when they enter social contract with the contracts with with the government does a room have power or do people have power people in institutions have power so then it's still people who have the power the institution is what is allowing them to enact their power yeah but who gives the institution the authority to do that also the people so then it's just people who have the power through institutions yeah but institutions have no autonomy no consciousness no nothing that would just just be people or the institution right can you have an institution you would say you have as much power as the President of the United States of America right now no I would say that uh not even close his power was given to him by the institutions that make up the American government no his power was given to him by the people and who institions yeah they that's true but they're the ones who Empower it and the same thing with the military protecting it the institution itself has no power absent people is my point so it's just it really just comes down to people so if you were to say between men and women which sex do you think uh enforces rights would you say it's more along males or more along females I'd say it's both yeah but more or is it exactly equal you think there's really no delineation um because of the nature of the citizen and the state relationship uh both all citizens in a society are equally giving up their rights to for the purpose of the government to say okay we'll protect your these rights if you give up certain other rights so I'd say I don't I don't actually know what you're saying right now what do you mean okay let me let me try and rephrase that a little bit better I don't think it's unequal as to who enforces the rights okay I'd say men and women enforce them equally because they both have to give up some of their rights in order to live in the society that enforces the rights which rights do they have to give up um well I couldn't pull out a gun and shoot you right now could I do you think you you think that that's a a right not a but well don't you not think rights exist anyway um I mean whether I do or I don't I that still wouldn't have anything to do with a previous statement of you gave up your right to you're giving up free will you're giving up something yes you're giving up something in exchange for rights which is yeah why don't what are you giving up free will you're giving up have you ever like Hobs Leviathan man in a constant state of War where they pursue their own individual selfish interests we give that up in some part not fully but in some parts to agree with a government in a contract we're not going to do these things if you protect us from other people who are going to do those things okay and who's doing the protecting um it it's people who are hired to the institutions by the government paid with tax dollars that are funded by both men and women so I'd say like the United States military uh yeah would you say that that's um mostly men or mostly women the military is not an enforcer the way that we've been talking about it though the police would be the enforcer the way we talk why would the military be enforcers I'm I mean like in terms of foreign foreign matters because then you're not enforcing rights you're enforcing that's on an international scale you're enforcing your nation's sovereignty well that would be enforcing the rights of the people that's the nation's right to sovereignty that's not a people's right they're two different japanes if the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor um isn't the United States military going to be enforcing your rights at that point if a foreign body invades um they're not aren't they protecting you the same way a police officer would be in that context but States aren't motivated to do that particularly just to protect my individual life it's to protect the sanctity of a state as a whole because the state protects the rights of the individuals within the state so they're there to protect the state who's protecting the rights of you so they're protecting your rights okay yeah I guess sure and they're enforcing your rights I con seeed what is the what's the implication of that keep well is it mostly men or women um in the military it's mostly men mostly men and then in the police force mostly men mostly women I'm not I I guess it's mostly men mostly men in fact can you think of a single enforcement agency which is not mostly made up of men I don't know maybe the Environmental Protection Agency the EPA that's an enforcement arm of the government do they actually have an enforcement Wing umz like the IRS does the IRS has an enforcement arm of the IRS they carry guns the whole nine yards but that's mostly the agents there are mostly men too I'm pretty sure the EPA has to handle um permits for businesses that are like um polluting a lot yeah that wouldn't be enforcement though enforcing a law it's not enforcement that is enforcing a law how is it enforcing if there's regulations on how much uh emissions a company can have and the EPA is tracking their emissions and charging them or or otherwise punishing them putting them out of business etc for breaking those rules then it's an enforcement of a law so if it's enforcement this requires Force that's entailed in the word enforcement yeah and that it so what force are they using or are they appealing to another another Branch to use Force they're they're using the institutional Force that's yeah but if a business says no we're going to keep dumping our oil in this Lake right does the EPA eles actually come out and physically stop them from dumping the oil in the lake or do they send them a strongly worded letter is the question probably a strongly worded letter I think eventually people might come out and do things physically and yeah those people would probably be men but I don't see the point of your argument it's just an argument that men are physically strong I haven't even made an argument so I don't see how you can see the point if I haven't even I'm not sure what you're setting up for but I'm very curious well right now I'm just trying to figure out the delineation of who actually enforces the laws the laws themselves not people who write the laws not people who make judgments on the laws but the people who actually enforce the laws the government the institutions that make up the government institutions cannot enforce a law okay people have to enforce a law it's like saying the prison institution will make you go to your cell the prison institution does not make you go to the cell a guy with a night stick makes you go to a cell right but why does he have to do that uh well it's his job he doesn't have to do it who gave him that job uh well in this case it it would be the prison uh is that a government-owned facility sure so he has a government job sure so he has to do whatever the government tells him the not the government the people in the government who are in those institutions who then give him the mandate to do what ever the job is the institution itself is just a building right or an idea it's a conflation of people so you're making a category error when you say an institution can enforce okay it's people who enforce and it's people who are the institution in the government enforce and they yeah that's mine well they don't always have to be in the government right um explain yourself well like you can have a citizen's arrest you can have you know various things like this where there's enforcement going on but you're not a government agent of any kind and you can enforce your right to self-defense without being in the government right uh I disagree the government has is the one that gives us the right to self-defense so the government gives us a right to self-defense they delineate it like I said after the social contract the people give the government the the people give the people in the government the right to enforce it okay so then last thing is when it comes to rights themselves do you think that rights exist it's a very it's a very interesting topic that you've given to me multiple times I think like you've said many times about different axioms and stuff no they do not tangibly exist but because the enforcement of Rights has physical repercussions I'd say that rights are something that exists in various societies governments legal codes constitutions they're present but yes they are intangible they're intangible yeah so they're just conceptual yes they don't actually exist as part of any type of physical reality they're just ideas that we will follow the same thing with the Bible but yeah I mean sure we you can you can say that I'm just asking specifically they're just ideas though right yes just like the Bible it's just ideas okay it's just ideas so if that is the case then these ideas for rights which do not exist and then these men who are mostly enforcing this these rights who do exist men you would say would be the rights enforcers they would have to be there's mostly men who are enforcing rights and under this ideal or idealism that you have that we should follow rights you would need to have people enforcing them those are mostly going to be men enforcing rights I feel like we've talked in a circle here just and I think the fundamental disagreement is that I believe women are just as capable of men as enforcing rights and I don't think that physicality is a valid enough argument to against it so then can you tell me why it is that there's never been a case in the history of all of mankind where women have collectively enslaved or men but men have always been able to collectively enslave women it's because men are physically stronger well then what are you talking about women are just as equally capable of enforcing their rights because guns are an equalizer yeah but we've already distinguished that they don't make you equal to a man just because you have a gun we disagreed there okay well then can you explain how somebody's better apt and can carry far more ammunition and handle a weapon better how it's equal to a person who cannot um first of all like we said there are many exceptions to that case there are many women who could probably carry more ammunition than a small weak man yeah but those would be exceptions which would make the rule that most women are not as good at it as most men also women do not make guns they don't create them they don't manufacture them they don't draft them they for the most most part stay completely out of the industry there's almost no women working inside of the gun industry as far as the production into of it goes some in the sales end but they don't even produce the weapons so same thing when you're talking about tanks tanks also require a higher amount of physical strength uh male tank crews are going to do better than female tank Crews and this is because you have to put on Treads and you have to put in shells and you have to carry heavy all day so it's not really just saying well a woman can carry a gun um I I don't really understand the argument because yes men also carry guns but can do so much more than that with the guns okay well it just I've proven that women can be enforcers even if it's less well than men men can be right would you con to that but then that would mean if that's true that men can utilize Force even against enforcer women and take away their rights that's the point so do you think like a a man who is able to escape the grip of a female police officer mhm you think he's just going to be free for the rest of his life and never get a right never get enfor men are going to come get him men who enforce rights are going to come get them but generally speaking Yeah women and men cannot equally enforce rights there's no I mean that I there's never even been an example of it ever has never happened once so my argument would be to you that if tomorrow collectively men said women have no rights they would not and if collectively women said men have no rights they still would because women would be unable to enforce that mandate or as men could that's false because they could at least partially enforce it there would be a war between the genders if we can both own guns uh I don't think that there would be as if you take a look at some of the historic examples including overseas there have been many instances where women can own guns and have guns but if men take their rights away what good are your guns you what are you going to do collectively women there's no possible way for them to put up a fight against men can't it can't be done and do you think men would take women's rights away tomorrow they do it all over the the world all the time don't they then why don't they do it here well so this is a conflation of two different two different questions whether or not they do do it here we're arguing right now on if they could do it here if they could do what sorry I got if they could collectivize and just take away women's rights yeah could they yeah okay then why don't they yeah but that's not again asking me why why doesn't thing happen doesn't I'm just asking you about your opinion no necessity as whether not don't do that is it because of the feminist mind virus or get into that but before I get into that I still would like this question answered as to whether or not they can do that um I don't think so because women are OB did OBS just crash maybe it says we're offline check your connection internet crashed it could just be IV this happens to me all the time we're back here sit down I I don't know if the stream is still going though the white thing I think it is I have on my phone right now hey uh are we still live folks one in the chat if we're still live I apologize I don't know if you guys can see us or hear us we had a internet disconnect um we're going to try to fix this really quick so give us I very much apologize give us just one minute okay we're still connected yeah thata needs to be um oh yeah we just reload it should okay go on I think we're good go uh I would concede that men have a monopoly over the use of physical Force but that doesn't mean they have a monopoly over the enforcement of Rights then who does like I said institutions but it's not even just that someone has all the power power in most institutions that as a the a nation as a collective must enforce the rights of a Nation why must they or not must they but it's like what I was saying with the social contract stuff earlier if if a big enough group is dissatisfied with the way things are being run in the state um no matter what there's usually going to be some sort of Revolt push back non-institutionalized protest who usually fights in those revolts who usually fights in those revolts men men yeah so men are the ones who are either taking their rights or taking rights away for the physical revolts see Susan banthony during the fight for the 19th she didn't need to shoot anyone did she there's such thing as political activism nonviolent political activism would you say that political activism is not impactful on the nature of the institutions that make up our society Susan B Anthony had almost no power Rich industrialist or who got the 19th Amendment passed at the state level every single state almost without exception where there was a referendum on the vote for the 19th women were not allowed to vote on it they were not allowed to vote for their own voting rights in fact would make sense the anti-s suffragettes demanded or I'm sorry the suffragettes demanded that they not be able to vote and that it instead be constitutionally enshrined because they had tried to allow them to vote before and it did not pass so no Susan B Anthony did not utilize great political moving past that one case study do women are capable of political activism yes or no sure as as long as men allow them to be that's the that's my claim is that all enforcement is allowance so anything that women are allowed to do as an external Force anywhere in the world is because men are necessarily allowing that to happen that argument is based purely on physicality it's saying basically any at any time because a man could physically overpower a woman he could just kill her and prevent her from doing anything how is that an argument for a woman having less rights than a man the argument would also move to men as well so it would also be saying that uh men can do the exact same thing to other men and they can do this to women would agree but women can never do it to men okay what about women to other women sure then can they can't they enforce rights you mean can they enforce their their rights against other women yeah sure but they can't against men okay okay so I mean ultimately what we all we're establishing is that men enforce rights and that women cannot enforce their own rights and so since that is the case I do not believe that men and women are equal and since they are not equal then it becomes a why should we allow for women to have these rights when if if we have determined that they should not what would be the moral argument for it do children deserve rights uh limited yeah there's a moral argument to be made there I think but like do children get the right to vote true but I mean well they tend to frown on that right typically but the the argument is that someone shouldn't have to think oh my rights aren't going to be enforced simply because I can't enforce them what about disabled men do their rights not deserve to be enforced in society yeah men can take that away from them they could so you're saying a disabled man is the same as a woman yeah I'm saying that if you have that all rights essentially come down to force then you can chop it up either which way you want you can make as big of a group as you want or as small of a group as you want however you want to chop it up you can do you can do it with only tall men only mediumsized men only small men but ultimately it's going to be men who are giving rights and taking rights away but see you've pointed out multiple exceptions to the rule what if we remove all the exceptions and just say the strongest 50% of the population it's not going to be all men that would still be men well okay well let's say there's no way around it no no no no no well no there's definitely a multitude of men out there that are weaker than men women okay I I might I'm bad at math honestly but what I'm saying is like yeah you want to revise that you can't why would if you're basing it on biological physicality then what why does it have to be between the two genders if there are women that are stronger than smaller men if it's based purely on the use of force why don't we just base it on who is most capable of using Force like the Olympics or something what am I missing what are you doing here take this I don't know what the what what is all that about the there's a bit of white specs I was just trying to oh yeah I don't know okay what the OCD Brian sorry I'm I I don't want people to think you got dandruff and why would you use why would you use sex as the the determining Force if you've already admitted that there are people who break the exception and there are women who would be stronger than some men why don't you just choose the strongest people from each societ because the strongest people from each Society are going to still be the men okay but all right just just a little bit please Andrew please just like on on that side wait a little higher up what is there there's cotton here no just like there's a little white Puffs from the uh on the other side other side ases what is it from you want can I do it can I can I do it hold on Welcome to the whatever podcast bro Sor sorry sorry sorry are you serious is Ash some some ash freaking you out dude some cigarette what the some cigarette any there was a little cigarette droppings or something all so back to the debate sorry I'm sorry okay well remind me never get a barbecue stain on a white T-shirt around you dude I'm the comic relief over this guy loses mind you get a barbecue be like the whole time he would never be able to enjoy the barbecue he' just be staring at that guy the whole time yeah it's true it's true it's true yeah look at look at that sharp you look now hold on wait there's a little more I'm sorry a little more get it all ran there we go you can just I mean it's it's dug it's just dug in there that makes me want to like go smoke another cigarette just and flick it towards myself now but anyway um where we at oh yeah yeah when it came to rights yeah we've determined even at the highest level it would still be men right I've already conceded that the Monopoly of force I guess is with men but like I said so then the Monopoly of enforcement would be no because the enforcement of Rights is not purely physically done it's also done by stigmas and other things that you've talked about before ideas so stigmas contract stigmas can move obedience to the institutions stigma and what's the difference between Anarchy and governmental state if the only Monopoly of force is based on physicality yeah so stigmas for instance and um rrio ISM that could be a really good one to look at too all of these things can definitely influence a worldview or a viewpoint but that still is not going to change who's going to end up ultimately having to enforce the world viewer Viewpoint and it's not going to be women it's going to be men and this was the primary anti-suffragists suffragette arguments made by the non-feminist women um pre the 19th was look one of the biggest problems is is we're not fighting the wars and we're not ever going to and we're not going to ever act as the enforcement arm and society and we're never going to because we can't we're not physically able to do this job now you can point to some exceptions which can right some few women who can that'll always be the case but by and large it's never going to be the case because just on the average is that men are far stronger not moderately stronger they are far stronger than women and that's what gives them such a massive Edge when it comes to enforcement would you say that men who have never served in the military or the police force are not entitled to rights uh I think that you could make a good argument that if we were going to limit suffrage the best thing that we could do to limit it would be to have some sort of public service that men and women both had to do and if they were able to get through whatever that public service was I think the military would be a great example then they've earned that right that way somebody who's your age for instance who may not know as much as a person who's 50 or 60 can't negate their well-informed vote but rather you had to go and you had to in someway earn it so you're very much like a civic duty Republican in that sense I wouldn't say it's a civic duty Republican right but I would say that um if you're going to have a vote if that is a system we're going to have I don't see how it's even consentable to just let everybody participate in it most people are remarkably Pol Al uninformed they have no idea about anything at all why should we let all of them do that do you think we should have a literacy test I mean I think you should have a literacy test before you're even allowed to come in the country okay and I think that uh yeah would probably be a good idea to make sure that only literate people could exercise a a right like that for sure right yeah so you're saying there should be some sort of intelligence test at the polls before someone is able to act out their rights I think that you could even uh dunk down to some type of average until I don't think you have to be super smart to uh you know move into um to you know to move into the right to vote but what you do need to have is some kind of bleeding for it right so it used to be you had to own property or there was other criteria that you had you know now there's nothing everybody can participate and that seems like a really bad idea that so many people can get rid of an informed vote with their uninformed vote so what do you think are the the Criterion that they should have to fulfill I think that they should have to do probably six years of of mandatory duty to some kind of institution with no pay and then you they can have that right okay and you would be open to woman doing that too I would but just so you know an entailment of this is that most would not why wouldn't they because they don't now so when there are um and you you can actually go country by country where this is true where service is something which gives you an additional privilege women usually don't apply for whatever that is because they don't need to what's the point they still basically are pampered princesses in society right you're just negating them being able to uh well you're not even negating them they could if they go through the same service process but most of them don't why are women pampered princesses in society uh because basically men have taken care of all the infrastructure in such a way that almost all hardship is out of the way of women was that men's Choice um well I wouldn't say it depends there's a bit of determinism when it comes to how men operate with inventiveness and you have Capital things like this but yeah I would say ultimately it's a choice sure so just like it's a choice for them not to collectively enslave all women on planet Earth tomorrow that's a choice but um but still if you look at the logic of it it still seems that they could I would say that debunks any argument that I've heard that men have it harder because they have to provide for women you just conceded that it's men's choice that they make women pampered princesses so when you're this is actually kind of a silly argument well I'll gauge in it anyway because men make a choice right to feed their kid after the kid has acted out he's been a all day but they give him dinner anyway right they make that choice um did they do something they do something bad by doing that by feeding their kid even after the kid was a all day no but they did no I'm just going to say no no they didn't they didn't do anything wrong they should right actually feed that kid at the end of the day right yes even though the kid did all sorts of they weren't supposed to do yes yeah because that's a moral imperative that they feed the kid right so in this particular case there can be all sorts of terrible horrible female Behavior but that doesn't mean that virtuous men would just let them go out and die that seems absurd on its face but not only that most men aren't looking at it in the the way that we're discussing it we're talking about infrastructure being a necessary facilitation for women's rights to begin with which are men doing it they just naturally gravitate to those jobs they don't even think about the entailment oh that women benefit from this infrastructure they don't even think of it that way okay so you're saying it's a moral obligation for them to be merciful towards women and pamper them even when they're disobedient does mean that doesn't mean to equalize them any more than they would a child were you going to say something well I have a question unless you guys want to continue on this thread I I had something I wanted to say oh okay go ahead okay go ahead Brian wait can you repeat what you just said I'm sorry I don't remember now darn um it's okay just ask okay well I mean just moving things forward a little bit here you described yourself on the show as a black feminist can you explain that I might not that was trolling come on I might not have used it completely in the correct the correct way that it's meant to be I'm basically just an intersectional feminist but black feminism as a field of Academia is genuinely studied in the in a similar uh context or definition that I posed with intersectional feminism it's just I'd say it's more prioritized on the um uh the oppression of black women rather than other races so can you tell me do so you you're a practicing intersectionalist yes okay so can you tell me which is more oppressed a black uh lesbian or a Native American homosexual male you can't quantify oppression then what's the I don't understand what is intersectionality it's understanding the multiple cleavages that make up a person's identity in society CES yeah not like uh not like breasts cleavages like political science word like social cleavages like uh let's say white man straight those are all different cleavages so but just so that we're clear blacks are not as oppressed as whites or I sorry whites are not as oppressed as blacks right in America I would say no whites are not as oppressed as black people in America in America yes okay so so just so we're clear uh inside the United States black people are oppressed more than white people yes okay but I thought you just said that you could not quantify oppression yeah saying something is more than the other doesn't mean you can quantify it so then how the hell do you know it's true if it can't be Quantified a lot of things can't be Quantified they're abstractions it's based on someone's feelings how oppressed they are so what you're saying it it can't be Quantified but you just made it as a statement of truth that it is factual up to you and says you're an old white man and spits in your face that's an act of you know oppression or discrimination or whatever how are you quantifying that well I'm not I wouldn't say that I would be more or less oppressed than somebody else but you just did you just said this group is more oppressed than this group that's a quantification after you just got done saying is something which cannot be Quantified you were comparing two individuals before no I I said whites I said blacks in the United States are more oppressed White prior to that you were saying a black lesbian and a native whatever man or whatever you were about to say but those are individual can't be Quantified for individuals I I I mean I would also say that for groups of people but you can say historically there are trends of which races have been given more like you know uh obstacles in life but it can't be Quantified yes personto person at least like what are you going to say like oh I've experienced 350 acts of discrimination and they've experienced 360 I mean if it can't be Quantified then how can you say it as a true statement that whites are more oppressed than blacks or vice versa it's a historical Trend based on the power that's vested in institutions to make laws that differently apply to different groups of people in society yeah I I understand the explanation that there were laws which are tailored against this group of people over this group of people that sounds like you're quantifying it okay uh what number did I just quantify it with well I don't know but I would think that if you had x amount of laws that you could count them okay and then if you had x amount of laws on the other side you could count those two that would be quantifying it right I have a full count of them but I could give you a few examples like no but what I'm saying is is that if that's true that you can quantify laws you can count how many laws were oppressive to this group versus how many laws were oppressive to this group how's that not Quant Ying it but it's the the thing is it's not just laws there's a variety of other variables that you're not taking into account well it sounds like if it's a variable can it be Quantified yes but you can't quantify all of them because there's just it well which variables can't we quantify this just happens to be my belief I'm I'm being like idealistic I'm saying there's ideas that oppress people people are oppressed by their ideas that they hold in their day-to-day lives and those cannot be Quantified so you can go back and ask me the lesbian question if you okay hang on hang on people have ideas in their daily lives which cannot be Quantified which oppressed them would you say if you had a conception of yourself if you thought you were a woman let's say let's say you're still a man physically you're still completely a man but you thought you were a woman and you woke up every day thinking yes I'm a woman I'm biologically a woman whatever I was born a woman would you act the same as you do now when I act this um well no that would be impossible there would be if I picked up a penny every single morning um I wouldn't be acting the same way I do right now because I don't pick up a penny every single morning I'm saying would you continue to carry yourself in the same manner you do now I wouldn't if I picked up a penny every morning if you thought you were a woman yeah no but that would be true for any Behavior so any deviation Behavior would make me not how far would you deviate though are you going to start adopting more womanly roles you that is something we there's no way to make a determination of I'm I'm saying theoretically if you were a woman would you change your behavior from how you act as a man it's a simple question yeah of course yes but that would be true of all Behavior oh so the idea of being a woman causes you to change your behavior the idea of any change in Behavior necessarily facilitates your behavior changing yes so if ideas can cause people to change their behavior ideas about who a person is in society can change their behavior in physical Society so let's say people of certain race manifest itself as X and then we could quantify x what well so wouldn't that wouldn't that manifest itself as some type of grouping of laws or something like this which could be Quantified it it could after the fact but I'm saying while it's in someone's head that can't be fully bifi yeah but I mean that would be basically trivially true about everything on planet Earth anything which is inside of your head that would not ordinarily be inside your head it would be trivially true that you would be different than how you are right now if you thought a different thought than you do right now regardless of what that was yeah exactly so so I don't I so I don't really understand it does sound like oppression can be Quantified oppression can happen through ideas which are you would conc that ideas are not quantifiable so some forms of Oppression like things which are inside of your own head yes some form can't be externalized in any way shape or form so therefore we don't really know anything about them they can be externalized I I'm speaking right now on my thoughts inside my head and my ideology yeah but I mean if you were going to say for instance that you were a trans black woman right and you were like let's say a white person um that doesn't make me a trans black woman right yeah no but if you you could externalize that with behavior and can we just like count you so we could quantify then how many of you there are and then whatever the negative side effects are based on your joint experiences or whatever it sounds like there's ways you could quantify that it's not realistic at all well I don't I don't see why but I I feel like we're lost in the sauce at this point so um moving on from there I don't really know where the hell we were going with this Brian so I don't think knew either yeah well go ahead I mean we were talking about why um okay you're talking about I was saying ideas can oppress just trying to think of my greater Point here ah what were we talking about can I'll ask you a question back in your not I can just ask you a question yeah sure so I mean you're feminist if my understanding is correct your view is that in the United States there's a patriarchy is that correct yes Global patriarchy in all countries essentially perhaps stronger in other some countries have a stronger patriarchy than others yeah okay and are women oppressed under the patriarchy yes are you oppressed under the patriarchy not legally but but yes so what what are some of the ways that you're oppressed okay ways that I'm oppressed under the patriarchy um objectification let's say even though it was enacted by another woman when I came on the show last time she accused someone of trying to see my no no Zone as a female if I a man I don't think anyone would have accused that at all wait what that doesn't sound like oppression it that sounds kind of bad for the for the that sounds bad for the men not good for for The Men Who that happen it is bad for the men but what I'm saying is the over sexualization of women over time has grown to become bad for men because I don't understand how's that you being oppressed by the patriarchy thing that's a universal every woman is is oppressed by the patriarchy in that sense or I guess that would be the opposite I want to Sayed by the this chart and it over right every woman experiences sexism in the fact that they're typically seen as objects of Attraction before objects of intelligence what so I I know like like even I had a come in yeah usually women are like physical trophies rather than they're value is based you've said this before in the last podcast their value is based on their fertility rather than their intellect that is one value okay for attractiveness the patriarchy mhm how does the patriarchy impact me yeah oppress you oppress you based on what we were talking about last time you guys think that a good woman is a mother right and a um a wife right uh did we even make that I'm not sure that no there could be good women who cannot be mothers tons of them there could be so what are they supposed to do in life if they don't like get a job I mean they can do all sorts of things in life absent having a job I mean they can still be married and still be taken care of by their husbands and they could still adopt they could all sorts of things okay but I'm saying like you think that a woman's role is to be a caretaker in the home you don't think a woman should go out and be president of the United States no I don't think that well I can't get into that but let's just say no generally speaking yes I think that women are happy healthier uh at home rather than in the workforce because they all hate it and every time they get pulled on it they don't like working they don't like working long hours they don't like working they they don't like do you like working yeah you do I find come on really I find it to be more I'd rather have a fulfilling career in my future than stay at home all day no I I mean I would are you going to Outsource your the care of your kids to venez to a Venezuelan woman named Marcy or like what do you no is that what you're going to do or are you going to stay home with your kids why doesn't my husband stay home uh well because generally speaking men tend to be able to make a lot more money because they work a lot more hours actually women tend to I I'm pretty sure uh more women have college degrees than men do in today's society that's typically an indicator of earning potential um yeah it's true that doesn't mean they make more money but what I'm saying is a woman is could very easily today have a higher paying job than her husband she could yeah but they usually don't marry men when men ask the higher paying job that's the big problem there was a whole thing evidence for that claim well you can go to a channel called H maath not kidding it's called called H maath where he breaks all of this down and one of the things that he breaks down and he's using we've had him on the show by the yeah he's using publicly available data in order to do this is he shows that most women when you look at the earning potential inside of a house where there's wife and then later kids the earning potential of the man almost always higher than a woman before she'll get married to him in fact the reason the fact that this doesn't happen is one of the reasons that people clung on to the idea of hypergamy because it's so common place that women will not marry uh if the social status of the man is less than her including with earning potential can a mother not like earn money and also be a mother yeah I mean that used to be the status quo I used to either work out of the home or they would do secretary work or they would do you know education they would do work like that in fact uh feminism completely failed in its job and its Duty and its promise to women that it was going to make the world a safer place for women and children uh and that it was going to you know give all these different benefits to women it really hasn't given them much we want safety we want freedom of choice to make our own choices in society and not be assigned to a role of mother and caretaker that wasn't the promise of feminism the promise of feminism was that uh Society was going to be a lot safer and women were going to be a lot happier give one universal promise of feminism well we can look at what the original suffer Jets were pushing for and yeah we we can look at their writings and see what they said and that was one of the big Promises of feminism was that they were going to make the world a safer place and that um women were going to be happier in every metric we look at women are more miserable than ever and their mental health uh one in four suffers from a mental illness that's crazy to me one in Four Women suffers from some kind of mental illness they don't seem like they're happier and more well adjusted they seem like they're more miserable and not well adjusted and and while it's true that you can sit here and tell me that you love working I literally don't believe you cuz nobody loves working nobody loves it like very few people you just happen to be like for instance how many hours did you work last week was it 60 was it 50 was it less than 40 I'm literally a full-time student it was not 4050 or 60 right maybe 15 about that but that's not relevant to the point it the point is that if I enjoy going out and doing my career more than I do taking care of the kids at home then why am I tied down to that outcome just because I'm physically weaker that's the never were tied down to that outcome you could just not get you could just not get married but if you are married the optimal system if if you actually value your children is to stay at home with them how are they going to get better results than their mother at home with them while their father works that is the most if you can give me a more optimal system for raising children than Mom at home or dad works I'd love to hear it a more optimal system for raising children both parents at home neither work that would be entailed impossible right for most people what's the difference between that and having Dad take care of the kids I'll ask her next question just like I've been answering all of your questions but answer mine can you actually think of a better system than Mom at home with the kids and Dad working what could possibly be more optimal for the children than that for the children um having two moms that would be more optimal they probably get nurtured better you guys say mothers are better caretakers so I just want to make sure I got this right first of all you would you would the babies would have to come from somewhere right I I thought adoption was a huge thing that you just talked about yeah but even if if we were to entail that let's just say I granted your argument and two moms would be optimal based on them adopting children there's only going to be x amount of lesbians which is a very small demographic and x amount of children to adopt which is also small demographic so that still could not actually be optimal even if I granted that it was better in certain circumstan it could not actually be optimal for most of society to do this that would not be optimal and neither is a woman staying at home and a man going out and working because um increasingly more we see the need for women go out and work um no we don't if women retracted from the marketplace tomorrow and stay at home men's wages would necessarily double or triple okay um so if all women didn't work and their rights were attached to the men that were next to them mhm what if their husband dies then they would do what has always been done and be able to inherit land like I can give you an example of this happening George you know who George Washington was yes who was he the first president of the United States yeah he was married to Martha Washington and they had a big falling out at one point in their marriage because she didn't want to free her slaves which she inherited as part of a giant estate she didn't want to free him and he couldn't make her because women have always been allowed to own property that's never been a problem and if if the man dies though they always were able to inherit his that's why she was able to inherit from her father what about bank accounts and credit cards what about them that's a very recent development that's true but do you know when it came to credit cards why it was that women didn't have credit cards it's because men were responsible for their debt women couldn't incur debt it was illegal so women couldn't go with a credit card and spend at a store the man if if she did the man was responsible for everything she spent for her husband so that actually made a lot of sense especially women aren't working they might need lines of credit but that would fall to the men so if women needed to go get whatever they needed put it on their man's account that would take care of that pretty good system and if it comes to what's optimal for children doesn't that seem like it's pretty optimal black flame NOA donated $200 I wish more woman on this show will like you even though you're a feminist at least you're respectful listen and have a good chat also props to Andrew for handling this so well hey can shut up now yeah anyway I don't know where we were at but yeah we were just discussing why that was with credit cards and bank accounts made a lot of sense yeah but that's you guys were asking me to list examples of like patriarchy or oppression that's one of them right being unable to it doesn't sound very oppressive manage your own finances that doesn't sound very oppressive it sounds like you can just go get whatever the hell you want and somebody else has to pay for it I don't know why that would be oppression that sounds like the opposite of op like if you were to go to a man you think and you said listen you're gonna stay at home you don't even have any children okay but you get to stay home and not work and you can go out and buy whatever the you want and you never responsible for the debt of whatever it is you go and buy you think that they would think that that you were oppressing them you make too many generalizations men nowadays aren't doing that for women women have to have I know that they're not doing that for women but it you were just complaining about this law that they couldn't have credit cards or bank accounts and I was explaining to you why that law existed makes a lot of sense why it existed because you're tying everything to a single income for the family and the optimal system and what was what was pushed inside of society and what's been tried to be dismantled by feminists and nuclear family but we used to push the nuclear family and so in order to make that optimal which is Dad Mom children you had to tie everything to one one income and people used to be able to afford to get a single car every couple of years they'd be able to go out get a brand new car bring it back they they need a woman's income because women because feminism under Rich industrialist flooded the market with cheap Factory labor which is what industrialist wanted cheap ass Factory labor and that's where women came from cheap ass Factory labor and that's what they cared about that's why they never gave them the vote people knew it even then and that's why the 19th was passed rather than a referendum state by state I I'm I might agree with that but my argument would be when men go to war who is supposed to work in the factories well in that case it was still mostly men who were designing weapons things like this what women were doing were low skilled jobs they'd put screws in packs they'd work on an assembly line putting a bolt in something they were doing kind of the menial labor jobs but those but those menial labor jobs would still have well paid less than who the soldiers who were drafted and had to go off to war were often getting paid far less than what they were making at their jobs so which would mean women need to work even harder to provide for their family during that time if men are beinged now women have to manage the finances of the home you can't complain that there was a yoking we but wait women made less than men it's like I compl beinged could also they would also make less than if they had stayed in those jobs so it seems like that's a sacrifice that um they should kind of be willing to make right okay yeah but we've conceded that there are times like wartime where women have to take on a financially providing role for family instead of going and dying terrible it's awful that's I mean man it sounds like they've really had it rough yeah but that's not the point is who has it harder it's that shouldn't women be able to have independent control over their finances from the beginning then well even in war time right when it when it came to this what control do you think that they didn't have they're still able to access these accounts they just weren't responsible for them they could get a bank account just through their husband's name they just weren't responsible for the debt yeah so if they got too much debt for their husband I bet they would come home and their husband would beat the out of them you don't see what kind of argument is that husbands weren't coming they were coming home and them they weren't coming home they weren't coming home and beating them they were coming home and making you think the first first thing they thought when they got home was hey baby where's all my money smack smack smack or do you think that if they hadn't seen a woman B seen that they haven't seen a woman after multiple years in a war theater and they got home what do you think they were thinking about cuz I got to tell you I don't think it was about where did the money go I don't just mean in a war theater I mean just like from a day at work they come home the wife spent too much of your money they're going to they're going to beat the wife up the Bible says to the Bible says to raise your hand at your wife if she disobeys you you should be able to demonstrate or show that women were being abused at these much higher rates especially domestically they were not but what is happening is that children are now abused at a much higher rate because feminism has broken up the nuclear family so what happens is women they'll have most almost all children now not all I'm sorry but almost over half last I checked uh are not born in wedlock anymore the children which are born single motherhood is at an all-time high and it's going to continue to increase and what happens is if you bring in a non-biological parent into the home the chance of abuse for your children drastically increases I mean it drastically increases with a non-biological male parent stepdad you're putting the responsibility of women on the lack of fathers but you have to know that it's not completely on the responsibility of women right well I'm not saying that uh women bear a full burden or responsibility for um you know a man abusing them so they have to get a divorce or uh you know any number of these different cases but what I am saying is that women are far more likely to end these marriages at a much higher percentage you're talking college educated women like you it's as high as 90% of the marriages which are ended are initiated by them and then uh you know about 67% uh of General marriages are ended by women and it's for reconcilable differences not for abuse it's not not for abuse not it's um you know like number four down the list is money but the first one's a reconcilable difference is I just didn't want to be married anymore not because of abuse yeah so I forgot like what point we were trying to build to well we were building in feminism being a destructive path to the nuclear family and how that's one of the primary reasons that I oppose it and then I gave you example after example of how it has done that is okay so you're saying because feminism is driving up divorce rates that's why it's destroying the nuclear family that's only one reason the other reason is because now it requires two incomes in order to raise a family which means that more and more women have to send their kids off to public school public school gets extended longer and longer periods of time because it ends up being a babysitting platform for women or for women's children so basically the public schools have now become uh your built in babysitter and then you have latchkey kids who come home and you have uh these two income families rather than having the mom at home which is of course optimal and that's because we have two parents in the workforce and we should really be trying to strive towards just one parent in the workforce that would be optimal for the kids right why does that one parent in the workforce have to be the man well they don't have to be but men can do most of the jobs that require the that infrastructure requires women can still work they work as nurses in fact they work in the same uh jobs that they kind of work in now they gravitate towards which is service work clerical work nursing but what they don't gravitate towards is working on oil rigs working on ship rights working on docks work working on infrastructure uh AC control they don't work on any of that stuff and so generally speaking women can be in kind of support societal roles and that's fine but it would be optimal if we were able to pull them back away from that more and more and more and instead incentivize them to stay at home with their kids because that would drive wages way up that would be very helpful for society and it would be better for the kids more men would have lower paying jobs wouldn't it no wouldn't that be the case no so it's it's just supply and demand so if you have the only cup in the world it's worth a lot more than if everybody body has the same Cup right yes yeah so it's the same thing here if you reduce the workforce by 50% then they're going to be able to demand higher wages for the job vacancies because now jobs are competing for them no jobs wouldn't be oh wait hold on you reduce the work I told you I'm bad at math I don't know okay Brian I don't know where else we go with this man okay that up Brian pull up lesbian domestic violence statistic images kids in that house and a good woman gets whatever she wants these 304s don't get yeah so he's saying that the domestic violence for lesbian couples is also through the roof that's true but I was just willing to Grant it to show you that it still wouldn't make for the kind of outcome on society that I think we're looking for from a person has the harm principle see this is the thing about a good woman gets what she wants These Hoes don't get what is the equivalent to that for men uh like oh a man who makes a lot of money gets what he wants and the rest don't get that's not true because okay yeah maybe they can pull less women but in this case you're saying a woman who's bad is subject to being treated worse by their partner being hit being punished for their failures I don't know versus if a man fails he just doesn't get a mate he doesn't get physically abused well I mean if you didn't have a mate you wouldn't get physically abused either right yeah but in this scenario I need a mate in order to have a bank account so well no You' get your bank account through your father until you had a mate what father yeah well you're the ones who want to destroy that nuclear family so that used to not be such an easy thing to do to let your father walk out let my father I let my father walk not you I'm just saying to let a father walk out on uh their family let let it's never a father's personal choice to just walk out on his family there's social stigma which is applied often and church stigma which used to be applied often and the state could come in and actually make fathers take care of their children yes they actually did do that not joking okay same goes for like you just said that a man shouldn't wait okay never mind I'm gonna sound stupid okay we have a chat here gr Gracie says blank on one some of these young ladies are very respectful introspective I must ask what convinces a woman that competing in business with men is more important than nurturing the Next Generation if you'd like to respond that's a good question I think that like I like I said earlier I just have a very individual View and I think that may maybe it's kind of a hedonistic view in this sense but people should be able to do whatever maximizes their own happiness and if having a career and being a business owner is like maximizes my happiness more you don't believe that though you don't believe people should be able to do whatever they want to not whatever they have to concede to some things in the social construct with the government then why can't they ConEd to let us make a social contract with the government that requires you to take care of your children and nuclear family and that's what we move to as a society to minimize because that's based on the Bible it's not no I'm talking about minimizing harm I'm talking about minimizing harm there's no what okay can you quantify for me how much harm is caused by the nuclear family being broken apart well yeah I can give you tons of M I just went over a shitload you want to go through them again yeah sure let's start with the metric of divorce rates increasing the amount of women that are on the pill uh let's talk about but you can't prove that those are being caused by feminism we can we can look at policies going back to when the 19th amendment was ratified and we can see who pushed for no fault divorce which was feminist we can see who pushed for the pill which was feminist we can actually yes we can actually track uh we can track all of this data in fact the the CDC does the pill a lot of these data well I I think that the pill might be one of the reasons that the mental illness rate in women is so high because it their hormones all up okay and the milk you drink doesn't your hormones all up don't even ask me I don't well I don't drink a lot of milk but uh I can I can understand that but you know there's laws in the books you can't drink raw milk okay but I'm saying there's and there us to be that people could but now there's laws saying you can't and yes you're right there are hormones inside of all types of food that can your hormones up for sure but not nearly as B and that's over time Plastics will do the same thing we were talking about that earlier I agree with that that's one thing we can find common ground on right foods can have all sorts of hormones antibiotic resistant pathogens in them um but that doesn't change the fact that mental mental illness likely is increasing in women due to the fact that so many are on birth control you can't just take a fact and put it next to another fact and say that one causes the other where's the reasoning there's no argument being made that one is not pre valid premises for the argument well we'll try this then do you think um when it comes to reproduction that the pill has decreased reproduction in women has decreased I couldn't tell you but it is a preventative measure you don't think it's it's reduced reproduction yes it has it has if every woman I don't know it's that's just a correlate you can't just put one thing next to another thing and then make this bold claim that correlation makes causation right if every woman was to have been taken off of birth control from the beginning of its creation and had sex all those times until now without the birth control there would be a lot more babies born but that's still just a correlate right I just explained to you how one causes the other because the birth control literally prevents the pregnancy but all causes just use strong correlates all of them just so you know go go back to what you were saying what was the point you were making you said the the point that I was making was that the nuclear family and the damage which has been caused by us getting away from the nuclear family can be Quantified and then I was explaining the ways in which it can be keep going so one of the things that I brought up was mental illness in women and the fact that so many women who uh are on anti-depressants especially they're able to correlate that with the fact that they're on birth control pills how do you know that they're not depressed because of outside reasons because they take them off the birth control pills and they become less depressed that's how oh yeah do you have a study for that one did you have a study for the correlator that you just gave no but it makes sense right but yours okay that's fine uh other there is data for that any other quantifiable fact there's tons there can be genetics involved if you come from a single family household that seems to have more of an impact on uh girls unless the girls are raised by the fathers and then if they're raised by their fathers instead of their mothers it seems that evidence for the claim that a single family influences girls more heavily I mean a single parent family because single parent well that's not my claim so my claim was in a single parent family where there's a woman uh single mom who's running the family the outcomes for the children including mental illness seem to be worse than if there's a single dad the outcomes still aren't good they're not like Optimal it's not it's not what you'd like to see they seem to be better from a single father household when it comes to mental illness than a single uh mom household when it comes to mental illness in the kids because single father households tend to make more money no yes no because true because up that that is true single father households make more money variable out of there which is that the state aid which comes in to single mothers along with child support will often compensate for that income gap this would include food money free healthcare trust I know all about it yeah but I mean it does it does compensate so if a man makes $4 an A on average more per hour than uh you know a single mother uh that will disqualify him from potentially hundreds of dollars in food aid plus free health care on Medicaid yes but so re why that state aid exists so heavily is because historically men have discouraged women from working and have encouraged them to be mothers they're less capable to work and high earning jobs before they need more welfare when their husband or I'm not even beating up the welfare men can qualify for the same welfare if they make less I'm pointing out that your argument that the reason there's less mental illness inside of the children is because because uh mommy doesn't make as much money as Daddy would when it's clearly compensated for by state aid would you say a section A department is the same as an apartment paid for by Daddy's salary yeah but Daddy but here's the thing no in the neighborhood that they're living in O that's most okay so most of the men who would be involved with a woman who's in Section 8 housing would also be in Section 8 housing but that's not what I said that the men I didn't say that they were together I said that men higher earners yeah that's true but most of the women who are single moms are not living in Section 8 Housing and the other thing to look at not even close not even close are they living most single moms living in Section 8 housing not even in the same universe true they could be living in more poverish conditions maybe a you know barely making in meat for their three bedroom apartment or their two-bedroom apartment for their kids but the dads have to deal with the same exact thing it's just that if they are earning more then mothers are compensated for that lack of earnings from the government that Medicaid is as high quality as um Medicaid Private health insurance yes Medicaid some of the best insurance on planet Earth along with Medicare it's fantastic then why don't we universalize it uh because then we basically a subset of the population would have to be paying for everybody's which right now still not optimal that we have to pay for everybody's that's why because because you can't afford it because universalization in Canada did not work out very well and that's why people go to uh hospitals which are privately owned even though they're not supposed to they just turn a blind eye so that people can get their healthare that's why but that aside moving back to this I'm not going to let you evade this your claim was that single moms make for more mentally ill children because of this earning Gap I didn't say that particularly because and I I said it could be a factor no what happened was I asked I said one in four uh with the single mom and he said the reason for that is because they make a lot less money but that's not really true then I can backpedal that's not the only reason I think that likely it could be one of many reasons okay what are some other reasons that uh children coming from a single mother household are more likely to be mentally ill yeah let's see um I bet they wonder why their dad's not there wouldn't they wonder why their mom's not there if they were with her dad huh I guess that's a valid point let me think a little harder let's see do you have an explanation uh well yeah so uh essentially it has to do with who you bring in so what happens is with single moms they tend to bring in stepparents far more more than single fathers do far earlier um and they don't work out those relationships don't work out and so the that's a generalization yeah because saying one saying one in four women suffer from a mental health issue so there's a mental health crisis the Mental Health crisis is a generalization but it is still true okay so in this case yes they bring in stepdads and stepparents and so the children are more likely to deal with some forms of abuse and destabilization or in single father house holds that doesn't happen nearly as much that's why okay that that could be a verifiable reason like in your situation right um did you did you have like stepparents my dad was the only one who saw women after my mom did not see a single person in your in your situation yes yeah so I mean generalization of course of course that can happen but and aren't men more likely to seek out fertile mates than women are yeah so well no it's not that they're more likely to seek out fertile mates when what we were discussing before was signs of what men would find attractive and the reason I said they find youth attractive is because of fertility so that's probably one of the reasons they find youth attractive okay but what I'm saying is like it I don't think there's like a I I don't know you'd have to pull up a statistic but is there really a rate at which one sex brings in a stepparent more than the other yeah there is it's the women yeah we can look at the remarriage certif or the the remarriage stats so that we can understand that and then that would be inaccurate though if it was just the remarriage stats yeah but I was going to give you more so you can look at that that's one metric that you can look at it there's also polling done as to who have living boyfriends who doesn't uh Pew research has a bunch of this I don't remember what the polling agencies are uh everyone which has you know covered it but yes it is true at least it's true as we know that women do tend in to bring in more step parents can you give me the point difference on those two statistics can't you don't even have an estimate like a point you mean a point difference 10 percentage points or how how much how much is the difference I don't know I don't know what the distinction is but it's significant it's a significant distinction okay so I mean it's enough for there to be a deviation so I mean probably 15% 20% more I would get so how is that the women's fault though because they're trying to find another provider for the home that you think is an important part of they saying they should grow up in a two parent home what if the original provider left and you're saying the kid most divorces don't happen because the pro the provider left they happen because the woman initiates a divorce due to reconcile oh what about what are the PE the women who get left going to do that if we were just dealing with exceptions we we're not dealing with just exceptions we're dealing with a large portion of the that's not a large portion men and women are individuals stop making it so based on your gender only women can break things up only women can leave the relationship that's not true men all the time yeah but you're saying that it's an exception which is false you can't say exception it's sometimes one things one thing happens and sometimes other things happen so here's the here's the thing when people in it could be chosen by I'll rephrase it the best way that I can then mostly women are doing this and not men mostly women are leaving marriages and not men mostly women at the college college level it's almost all women then men are the exception because women are initiating 90% of the time and then if we break those stats down along religiosity we might come up with some different numbers but yes it's mostly women breaking up the home and yes how you know that's not men's fault well because we can ask these women why the divorce happened and we can look at court documents for the reasons that they put for the divorce and we can run different polls where we're talking to them and what we find is the same thing that was pulled up the other night here on whatever he was a perfect guy I just got sick of him I don't like him anymore there was no abuse he didn't do anything wrong I just don't like is she not entitled to make that choice if she doesn't like her husband anymore I think that if you put your own self entitlement above that of your children uh in order to have access to their father in a two parent household you're setting him up for failure and that's what we see in the stats that you should be if you make the commitment to make children with him and he's not abusing you okay and he's not beating you up and he's not abandoning you he's not doing all the bad things uh then no I think you should put your children before your own happiness I think you have a duty and obligation to do so aren't the children being exposed to the unhappiness of your marriage uh well that depends um it I mean it it completely totally depends aren't your children though even if they were exposed to the unhappiness of your marriage if you're looking at this the statistics of how much abuse happens external to that when then when these divorces happen and the outcomes on children in these single parent households wouldn't it still be optimal for them to deal with Mom and Dad you know they don't always talk to each other but they're in the same house they take good care of us and she prioritized the happiness of us over herself I don't think children are that capable that but you're putting the onus of the responsibility on the female which is just they're the leing they're the ones leaving my God that's why what if it's cuz they don't like how the man is treating the CH the children that's not what they're reporting you think they're reporting completely accurate every single time not every single time but accurate enough accurate enough for us to get a pretty clear picture in why they're leaving and they're not leaving cuz Dad's beating up the kids or beating up some cases they are and those aren't just exceptions those in those cases I would encourage um those women to leave those men if they're getting beat up or things like that they should be leaving those men but if all that was happening is women were leaving abusive men okay fine you wouldn't see this type of mass decadence in society this would not be the issue the single mother households are not reporting that they're leaving or filing for uh these divorces due to anything other than self fulfillment not because of abuse not because of drugs and not because he's leaving the home not even because they're shering their financial responsibilities a lot of the time so it's like marriage is work and yes you should should probably sacrifice your own happiness for the happiness of your children yes I think that a woman has responsibility to do that and so does a man I'd agree but what are the implications on that argument that we would probably end up with much better more stable nuclear family households and the reproduction rate would probably Skyrocket and women would probably not have to work nearly as much as they do right now and probably be way happier and less mentally ill that's what I would say it probably be the extension of that but that's not all because of feminism that's all got its roots in feminism yeah all no I'd say a lot of it has its roots in the patriarchy which things um well first of all Fe feminism was made to begin with to counteract the patriarchy that was the rhetoric so there you go you could say feminism would have never happened if there was never a patriarchy and we started with an egalitarian society but that wouldn't have been possible because we hadn't invented GS yet and men had an can't have an egalitarian society that's why we went through that whole thing in the beginning showing you why you can't we can't have an egalitarian society we can't because men have the Monopoly on Force that's why we we disagreed on that though like I still think that women can in have Force I mean they can use Force to a limited degree but they cannot enforce they'll never be the enforcers and so they're going to be equal with men it's not ever going to happen there's no place on planet Earth where women are like you know what Barbara grab the uzi we're going to enslave these right now it's never happened it's never going to happen but there has been the case where they've been like hey Abdul grabb the AK and uh yes the women have all been enslaved that has happened yes but I'm saying in today's society women have more influence on non-physical types of ways through politics and things like that yeah I don't disagree but ultimately they only have that sway if men allow them to through enforcement and if men collectively because they've had this before they had in Iran they had it in Iran they had women's Liberation in Iran until the Iranian and they were in politics and they had sway until the Iranians went no and took all that away and they can't do anything about it but you can have a revolution inside of a Nation by men that's done all the time and they're able to take rights or give rights that's just the way the world works and one of the blind spots of feminism is I don't know why but they can't seem to see that they can't seem to see that this Perpetual egalitarianism is worthless because you can never really achieve it anyway so I I don't know why they're striving towards it so hard why can't you get as close to it as possible well you can you can try to get as close to whatever you want as possible but these outcomes that we're seeing on your pathway there certainly don't seem great it doesn't seem like it was a great idea to wreck the nuclear family that seems like a really bad idea and they did it doesn't seem like it's a good idea to try to make men and women compete in the workforce that seemed like a really bad idea these are not good ideas for society and they haven't worked out very well on the but it it's like most of these are on the basis of your objective or not objective your subjective morality like you think that like what it's so much worse because those children are coming out mentally ill because they have single mothers maybe they're way more able to take on opportunities with confidence or something like that because they're um they are less prone to being submissive because they didn't have a father in the home they act more masculine so more mentally ill kids I'm saying the the things that you the problems that you have with feminism are it's because we're getting farther from the patriarchy right yeah and it's leading to really bad outcomes for everybody including the women so during the patriarchy it must have been really good like during the big part of the patriarchy like way back when it's been pretty good for most women yeah it's been pretty good so when it's been really hard on men but it's been pretty good for women almost every place you look for the equalization between the two men have had it basically way rougher than women was it not was that not their own choice if they're the enforcers they could have made it so that the women are the ones who have to do all that they did not allow women to participate in the political process and thus protect women and utilize women for what their role was which was to take care of children who said that was their role God uh the necessity of what is enforcement so they can't enforce they could not drive the Wolves Away at night literal wolves you know they used to actually be real wolves that would kill people at night in the countryside not a joke holy oh my God yeah I mean you you might think that this is um you know tongue and cheek but the world was a much more dangerous place and women relied on men men did not rely on them for protection and they still have to they just don't realize that they have to yet well now that we live in a society that has institutions that have power because given them power you mean like kings you mean like the church you mean like the guarantee rights the same way that our institutions do now your institutions do not guarantee rights yes they do your rights don't even exist and if a king you say King can't guarantee if they can be enforced then they exist okay well then if that's the case then you had tons of rights under Kings okay that you know that's not what I meant but my what was the original point that I was making the original point that we were making was about the nuclear family and how you want to see more mentally ill children because that means that they can take on more responsibility I didn't necessarily say that but you know not a not a bad take on my part from you rephrasing my argument I mean what's wrong with over what's wrong with overcoming overcoming mental illness I mean I think that could help a person have a lot of empathy for other people so if it is the case that you say what's wrong with having to surmount a challenge would you say that to an sa victim what's wrong with being ESS after all could actually make you a much better person that you overcame the fact that you were ESS does that make sense to you um I would not say that to them you would not say that to them but it's not the same thing okay but it is you're just saying that it could make you a better person that you have a mental illness and you're able to overcome or deal with it so should she have aborted the kid then so it wouldn't have to be born with mental illness how would you ever make that determination you just said one and four that's more than just an exception not born with they didn't say they're born with mental illness but they're going to develop it based on their familial circumstances according to you there's no way exactly there's no way to determine where the mental illness came from would you look could gen children anything any other factors besides so dumb there's no where to no way to determine which children will have it so not all children from single parents develop mental illness not all of them do so it's impos but so it's impossible to determine which ones will that's my point not that there still won't be one in four children with mental illness just that you will not be able to make the determination which ones are how could you ever do that I I couldn't even think of how that would even be possible okay you can't but okay so here's what we've gotten so far the the nuclear family feminists have destroyed the nuclear family and that's causing all the children to be mentally ill no that that has caused the workforce to um require a two or a two worker household that has taken children out of or mothers out of the home to raise their children that has cause a massive spike in divorces the list kind of goes on and on I listed a ton of things which feminism is the root cause of and feminism has what is the root cause of feminism uh occultism patriarchy occultism patriarchy feminism would have never you admitted earlier that feminism would not have existed if not to reverse the patriarchy and you just said that feminism is is the root cause of all these issues because we're trying too hard to reverse the oppression that you've put on to us so my first note was asking you is not an entailment is not an entailment of feminism going to be if it is to resist the patriarchy that there is a patriarchy answer is yes so I'm just looking at your entailment but patriarchy is not what caused feminism occultism is what caused feminism from the Protestant Church specifically the existence of patriarchy allowed the conditions for feminism to exist okay uh if Society had been more egalitarian from the start I'm not saying completely egalitarian but Society had been more egalitarian from the start where each individual was already able to choose do I want to take care of the kids or do I want to work let me go find a mate who's the opposite not based on the gender but just based on individual like their inclinations in life then I don't think women would be as yeah but you're hate hateful of men that's really funny that you bring this up you're saying that feminism La donated $200 it really is crazy how privilege is invisible to people who have it she has no idea how dangerous environment was long time now even now no one is going to provide her security other than men that's correct going be true but continue on anyway what you're saying is this this actually your argument I'll give it back to you you're saying P patriarchy didn't exist then women would not have to fight for the up conditions that we find ourselves in after they resisted the patriarchy brilliant argument genius love it um but that's your AR women wouldn't have to fight the up circumstances that the patriarchy put them in and they started with more egalitarianism right and don't we have more egalitarianism now than we did under the patriarchy and we find ourselves in these up conditions which means if we had egalitarianism then those would have been worse than the patriarchy in up conditions before too it's just different up conditions we well I mean women were just all tied down to one outcome and they couldn't vote they down to one out I would love my daughters to be able to do whatever the they want so you let me ask you this if we could guarantee let's just say we could guarantee that children would end up with way better outcomes in society we could guarantee it right if parents stayed together or even better let's phrase it this way we could guarantee that children will have better outcomes in society if women don't have the right to vote would you tell take away the right of women to vote then no no if we could guarantee that the outcomes for mental illness would greatly reduce if you took away the right to women of women to vote would you would you take away the right for women to vote no if you could guarantee that um women would be far more secure and actually much much much happier if you took away their right to vote would you take away their right to vote if you could guarantee that they would be happier if they could not vote would you take away the right to vote that would never happen no answer my question that I don't believe it would ever happen okay if you thought if the case could be made that their happiness would greatly increase because their mental illness decreases if you took away the right to vote would you do that it's not about happiness you're doing the hedenus thing on me in this case it's about individual choice and values not Hedonism but Hedonism is the out come I'm saying it's you're so what I'm asking you ultimately is this I'll condense it would you take away women's rights to vote if it led to generally speaking better societal outcomes that's that's not what would happen though and but if it were to happen that just generally societal outcomes got better would you take away the right to vote that's I I wouldn't you wouldn't I know and so this is the distinction between our moral systems is that I believe that you live in contradiction and that the right to vote this this right that you perceive or you know the 19th Amendment this type of thing that even if we could guarantee that the outcomes were better if it was gone you would still insist that it was there and I think that that's the case with abortion I think that that's the case with probably most of your beliefs because that's feminist belief like for instance if we could guarantee that women would get far less venial diseases and would have far less uh problems in society if we could criminalize premarital sex would you do it I wasn't listening to your question but one of those is an ideology I'm not going to debate with you okay repeat then I'm sorry well it's because I was thinking of what I was going to say next my fault for being a slow woman you can repeat your question if you I'll repeat I'll repeat the question and I'll make it even simpler what I'm saying to you is this is um if if we could make a law which curtailed female promiscuity meaning it was it was criminal for both men and women to have premarital sex and that led to better outcomes for society would you do it um no no so I mean ultimately for you the Hedonism and pure selfism is the most important value not individualism an emphasis on empathy and individual human rights empathy yes it is it's empathy for the individual because your ideology is not based on empathy it's based purely On subjectivism Through the Bible and religious I haven't offered a single biblical argument I'm just purely operating off ofis AR I'm literally going off of this the worldview is utilitarianism utilitarianism being harm this comes from Mill who says that harm is a physicality which exists in inside of the Norms of politics individualism Enlightenment I'm going off of your worldview which I wrote down and repeating back have not I said at the beginning before I told you everything that I could not fully describe my worldview with just random ideological things and you are already putting me in a box from that point I can just believe what I believe without having to classify it that's true you can right but ultimately it's incoherent and it doesn't make a lot of sense and when you say well wait you're coming at me with Biblical worldview no I'm just giving you back your own worldview I'm literally just I just ran an entire internal critique showing you that ultimately if we reduce all of these issues to outcomes for society you would still not curtail behaviors like promiscuity divor you wouldn't curtail any of these things even if it led to better outcomes for children because that's like Eugenics basically that is not utilitarianism ah okay I see um well you're right then yeah so anyway I'm good Brian I got some I got some more stuff actually something that just came from the questions that you were asking her so Andrew you asked her if outcomes were to be better for women if they couldn't vote your answer was um your answer was she wouldn't take them away I would still allow them the right to vote right right even even if under women not being able to vote the outcomes would be better you still wouldn't opt for that it's the same argument as don't you believe people have like free choice even if they can choose the wrong outcomes people should be able to choose their own life path you don't believe in free choice believe in Free Will okay then yeah Free Will is not choice so my question is though so and you said no you would not do that even though it would lead to better outcomes for women correct yes if it led to better outcomes for women for men to not be able to vote would you be in favor of that no okay that's fair no I figured you'd be consistent with that okay got it we have a couple chats why don't we read those so we have gr Gracie by the way guys get your chats in if you'd like we're going to go for a little bit longer young lady stop being so stubborn you're entering Prime baby making age find a good man start having kids and experience your best life seriously dying bar dying baren excuse me is a wasted life do you want to respond to gr Gracie H what if what if I'm infertile then what am I supposed to seek out adoption yeah are you okay but I I just I'm just curious like or a widowed man or any number of different ways that you would end up in a mother role um okay thank you gr Gracie for that appreciate it I'm going to pull up the Super Chat now we have Steven Carrera thank you man appreciate the Super Chat get a refund from your college you're getting real education with Andrew and not from Bolshevik infiltrate indoctrination daycare centers College okay if women do not produce Christian children while I hope you feminists like Sharia law okay thank you is Sharia law closer to the religious state that you guys might want I don't want a religious State okay the synergistic religious you mean economia oh sorry yeah so like if a Christian politician if they vote and they're inside of their head their morals are Guided by their Christianity right is that still a division of church and state yes because they're representing Christians who are part of their constituency gotcha so if we have mostly a Christian constituency and Christians go in and start making laws right like it would have to be done through a democratic process yeah even if it was done through a democratic process nobody saying it couldn't be right but you can have a democracy and still have economia with a church you can have a king and have economia with the church Christianity and Christian ethics can exist in any type of government even communism it can exist as long as the Communists don't wipe them out your Bible is just as intangible about as the rights that our current government is founded on except one of them expresses itself as a object of morality complete morality because of the good outcomes it creates in society for women and and children and what whereas the other one is just individual rights right no I don't think that's the case so I mean forgive me if I'm not following this correctly but you're saying that biblical values are just as subjective as rights as your rights and preferences yeah well that can't really be true even from a subjective angle because if if you say you're a Christian then you have to adhere to Christian ethics false well then you can't be a Christian isn't it just that you got to be saved you got to believe in God DED let me ask a question if you're born in Mexico and you live in Mexico are you an American obviously the question of citizenship is not the same as religious because there's a specific criteria right so you can't just calling yourself an American wouldn't make you one anyone who believes in God is considered okay it depends what sect you follow no everything has specific criteria Christianity faith in Christ Christian ethics they have all of them are subjective and they're all written down and made up by different but if there is specific criteria for Christianity then you would have to follow specific ethical Frameworks within Christianity from a secular framework of preference you're actually telling everybody to follow whatever set of Ethics they so choose that's isn't that better than telling everyone to just follow the one that you ascribe to no it's way worse especially for society do you want people to to arbitrarily decide whether or not they can murder based on their preferences so if everyone in America ascribed to Hinduism you just have a great time tomorrow with our new Hindu democratically elected it still be a Mor moral Society than if everybody was secularist who follow their own whims and preferences so that's just where we fundamentally disagree I believe you can have Morality In secularism and you think it's fundamentally impossible to be secular and moral how can you say that preferences are what is moral your own individual preference and nothing but your individual preference and then say his could be wrong about anything how can you do that well I'm not saying the individual preference of each individual person is moral I'm saying what the moral thing to do is allow everyone to have their own individual preferences then if you're then how can anybody justify that anybody else's morality is incorrect if okay but that's a subjective preference again we harm principle is not a subjective preference listen why should we follow the harm principle because it actually causes physical harm at that point yeah but that's not telling us why we should follow it I know it does it does cause harm but why ought we not cause harm because you're infringing on someone else's ability to exercise rights every day because like I said from the beginning it's about individuality you have empathy you treat every what's the Golden Rule treat every other person as you have yourself you say that's a categorical imperative but all of this will reduce if I keep categorical imperative if keep if I keep on moving down the the goal here it's going to reduced relativism why should we follow that why should we follow this why should we follow that eventually it's going to get down to because you would prefer that I do right there's really no other way around that so it's either religion or moral relativism that's right okay then anyone who's not religious you're a moral relativist congrats well but they all know that they all know that they're moral relativists like none of them now you know yeah it basically always reduces there could be some I mean some arguments I think which can be made against it but basically all of it reduces to relativism and preference so if it does and it's all just based on your preferences just things you prefer uh then you can never justify why this guy's preferences and that guy's preferences are no better than your own you can justify it based on the categorical imperative are you using other people or oppressing other people for your own person utilitarian the categorical imperative that's canis that's deontology they're in opposition to each other I wrote my college application essay on K then did you not know that Kant is literally the opposite of Bentham and Mill opposite 100% the deontology is direct opposition to utilitarianism one is consequentialism one's universalism so like I don't know yeah they're not even in the same universe was just saying I was uh we already showed that I'm not actually itarian you me up from the beginning because you asked me to classify myself and I don't know what I am okay well fair enough all right we have another chat here from Brian Jones hey Brian Jones thank you very much man appreciate the soup chat ladies and gentlemen it is soy half the things weat are made out of it it makes men more feminine and women blank blank blank okay Brian Johnson excuse me Bri about literal soy yeah it's in everything it's gross all right thank you Brian appreciate that get your last minute chats in if you have any let me just double check here we do have a streamlabs message from passable gamer ironic bringing up Eugenics when it was and has been a tenant of progressivism in the US Margaret Sanger Etc word I'm not his I'm uh her name sounds familiar but she was the person who founded Planned Parenthood oh my god wow I look awful now yeah um but interesting I wasn't never mind nothing to say continue I had one question earlier on in the conversation you mentioned something about Hedonism and I I I don't want to misquote you you said something along the lines of people should be able to do whatever they want and pursue like the maximum degree or amount of Happiness as long as it doesn't break the categorical imperative meaning they're not hurting other people in the process of doing so so but that's your kind of guiding philosophy not exactly I'd say Hedonism is more of like a personal Philosophy for me and I think that's typically in the that's how it's talked about in most contexts I was just saying I think people should be allowed to be hedonistic if they want to be the government shouldn't be saying you shouldn't be hedonistic you should be more and stay home and take care of your kids like the government's not the one who should be saying that but if the government say if you're saying the government shouldn't do something right they ought not do that then you're saying that the government shouldn't follow its preferences whose preferences should it follow the people's and um whose preferences should they follow their own then everybody's individualistic preferences are just as valid as anybody else's okay never said they weren't and so when it comes to the heathenism you said that's your own personal not completely I I just I was just throwing some words in there I don't know okay well I mean how would how does that manifest for you Hedonism I I was I was trying to use that more in the context of like he was saying that it would be completely evil of a woman to say like my husband makes me unhappy and you know I I'd rather just go live with my kids alone in Alaska and I'm saying that people should be able to do that and be hedonistic and chase their desires and they shouldn't be like at the expense of their children uh it's not always at the expense of the child maybe the child would have a better life not listening Mom and Dad yell at each other all day long use of at the expense of the children prioritizing her happiness over the expense of the children like hey left that part out but that's what I actually said the children can prioritize their own happiness when they get older oh no way you just said that that children can prioritize their own happiness when they those kids little bastards now you know why one and four of them have mental illness because they need to prioritize their happiness when they get older I see myself as one of those children who come from a broken home and I'd like to be able to prioritize my own happiness regardless of the circumstances that even over your own children um in the future if I had to divorce my H okay I don't want to get divorced I definitely don't and obviously but if you were going to be happier divorced even if it was at the expense of your children obviously I'm not going to live every day in misery but I would have to weigh the values at that time especially considering what the reason was for the divorce and you were you were unhappy you wanted to Jon down the street because John looked really good and had a nicer I wouldn't I wouldn't do that okay there's a difference between Hedonism and doing what you want I don't mean like agre that I don't mean like every single thought that you think of I'm saying you should be able to act based on your pleasure who prioritize their happiness they don't actually step out on their husband but they want JN they want Jon down the street they're not going to step out so they go to they go to their husband and they say listen I am miserable in this marriage and I want you know I want this guy this other guy who's not you and that's going to maximize my happiness they leave their husband and break up their family so that they can go pursue John you're neglecting to weigh how much happiness it brings them to have their like children happy and together with the family too because women do have to weigh that when they're thinking about whether or not they're going to divorce she doing something wrong by doing that is my question is she doing something wrong by doing that H I mean it's not right and I wouldn't I would want her to do it is it wrong she should not it should be legal it should be legal so yeah so I mean ultimately like the kids right it's not really wrong yeah but how the are you going to enforce a law that's like you you add fault to divorces so that there's penalties so that you can't go to your husband and say I want to go the neighbor that's you you gave me an you just gave me a huge exception like it could have been based on any other number of factors besides wanting to go the neighbor yeah and and all those factors can be taken into consideration for a penalty or an at fault divorce instead of a no fault divorce who's at fault for the divorce so if you decide to prioritize your happiness over your family you don't get to walk away and get the kids and get the car and get the house and get the money that they do that in divorce court anyways basically yeah but that's because it's a no fault divorce you don't have to show any cause for why you want the divorce and if you had to and then you could determine who's at fault and then you can split assets correctly because we know who the marriage up you went out and John down the Road or whatever right same thing with the husband that's a much better system okay I I recognize everything you're talking about is like bad for the kids but I still don't understand why you would want to bring the law into it especially if there's people out there who like I don't know might not I don't know well I mean the laws involved in it who might not even like think that the nuclear family is important at all like yeah that's true but that's really again when it comes to what is optimal for children if you are intentionally raising your kids outside of a nuclear family is like some kind of Fu to society then you're immediately doing something which is um you should probably think twice about right so if uh this and this happens all the time um essentially it's single mom regret right they'll go and and they'll get knocked up because they really really want to have a kid and then they go I really didn't think this through uh cuz kid wants dad you know kid wants a dad uh there are women who get now this isn't well studied phenomenon at all right I'm just bringing it up to kind of make an example but there are people who go and they impregnate women as a job they actually will go they'll show up to their house fathers right no no they're not surrogate fathers really well I mean they are but what they do is they they'll post an add-on Craigslist saying I will impregnate whoever and they show up to their house and they get these women pregnant sometimes it's with couples sometimes it's not but they did track one guy and I I read this article not too long ago they tracked this guy he had impregnated like 800 women okay tons I mean he had tons of kids out there um and they went met up with some of these moms and some of them were like yeah probably shouldn't have done that because I really wanted to have a baby but really think about the ramifications real Trump donated $200 I can't wait to see Andrew's wife on the podcast did a great job hosting the watch party yesterday and I can't believe Brian tried to get the most Conservative Republican chicken and rice WTS what the was that that was a personally offensive that one the chicken and rice he's never offended me before that was it you seemed a little upset by it oh just the previous stream we were door dashing some food and it was like pizza burgers and you got him chicken and rice no I I um no I got him a no I got a big ass cheeseburger got big big old cheeseburg real uh Trump appreciate the uh message I have another chat here that going to pull up we have t t donate 100 hey thank you man I don't know what I am okay thank you me neither bro that was the joke that was also a joke and that was my joke about your joke about that joke meta yeah yeah well that's meta to The Meta uh last two things here that I have notes for I believe on the show The Dating talk that you were on you had said something about you wishing you weren't borned that's something was that a joke that's something that I very quickly backpedal on okay I think it was it was definitely misconstrued I didn't mean it as like because if I you guys had a valid argument there if I did mean that then I basically was saying that I would have killed myself already but the argument with no no saying that word okay sorry about that un alived deleted would have self deleted yeah yed myself off the planet um but yed yeed yeed herself yeah but the point that I was trying to make was he's already mentioned so many times you know children of families that are not traditional or have really rough circumstances for the child um you know sometimes it can be the mom can know before they give birth that they're going to give birth to a child in awful circumstances with no father or not enough money to take care of them why would they put a child in that circumstance that's basically what I was saying okay okay I'm going to actually read this one just cuz it's a nice one Ben George thanks for having a cordial debate give her props for willing to be here let's hope she realizes she needs to prioritize her child's needs of her happiness and she does it for herself well there's great hope she's still a damn kid right yeah yeah thank you Ben appreciate it let me just double check everything over here uh I guess just final question on on the feminism topic so what rights because you know feminists are fighting for women's rights right so what rights do men have that women don't legally none none okay I think so then what the hell you need feminism for check like I said it's about the ideas not the laws it's about the fact that if I decided to work while also caring for my children I would be called a bad mother prioritizing my happiness over my child but if a man chooses to be more nurturing towards his child he's not considered a bad father for not going out and making more money instead it's like me men are allowed to love and take care of their children and be good Fathers while also working but women can only be one or the other no that's completely untrue it's a totally untrue bifurcation I don't know where you came up with this idea bad mothers are bad mothers bad fathers are bad fathers so there can be men who are I don't know I guess you could say far more paternal than men who are not who are far worse fathers than men who work all the time and there's men who work all the time who are far worse fathers than men who are highly paternal that's really not a good qualifier for that just like there's women who stay at home with their kids who are terrible mothers and there's women who work who are good mothers but all we're doing is we're trying to associate what we would like to see as a society same thing with egalitarianism you want all of society to move towards equality I want all of society to move to a different outcome which is towards a stable outcome inside of society which would include a patriarchal system which enables women to be able to stay home with their children cuz that sounds awesome it doesn't enable them it forces them it doesn't force them how are they forced what have I said here which would allude would allude to force because they're not allowed to work and they have to stay at home care children you just said they're allow to their kids to public school dayare yeah what you're trying to do is push Society towards women moving out of the workforce which means don't go to college and get a degree it's a waste of your time start a family instead and the government can even create incentives to uh have you start that's impossible in the current state of society though what what you just said no it's not incentives for if I didn't go to college I would be working at a fast food restaurant for the rest of my life no no you could get married and have children I could drop ship okay but no you could get married and have children and even have a home business what do you mean okay but I mean like what I'm saying is like let's say a woman is coming out of like poverty and there's no guarantee that men are going to provide for her because you know there's so much feminism out there and men who don't want to pay for women anymore how else is she supposed to guarantee her own Financial Security well this is the problem right is it's you're moving back to a prioritization of you and you should you kind of need money to live you do need money to live that's true but what used to happen is women would stay with at home with their parents as they would look for suitors who would marry them what if what if they hated their parents or their parents were abusive they just had to deal with but we don't want to move Society into all exceptions but that would happen and what would happen is they would move in with their aunts their uncles their extended families and these things were a lot closer together and they had a much better Community because there was a lot more of them in these in these uh you know cramped in areas which is a good thing I would like to get back to that to if women have it so much better in that patriarchal society then why wouldn't you want to be a woman in that you want to be a man in that Society how could I be a woman in it okay I'm saying theoretically theoret no theoretically I would wouldn't want to be a woman but that's because my ontology can't I can't really understand what that would even entail so I would I could never actually understand um like sex and attraction to men and things like that like I I can't I can't fathom those things but I'm not supposed to be able to that's outside of my purview I can understand to a degree you know what I mean like I can rationalize it and I can logically walk through it but I I don't really but I'm saying in the context of you're saying women have it so much better and safer in this patriarchal society would to be you want to be a woman in that societ if I had to be born if so logically I'd say yeah it would be way better to be woman want be born a woman it would be way better to be a woman you would not be talking to me on this podcast it be way better to be a woman inside of a patriarchal society like what we had even just a 100 years ago leading into just 80 years AG so you just want to stay at home every day and cook what you want what a rough life bastard patriarch men making us stay at home with our kids cook and have an enjoyable life those do you think unemployed people are happy I mean yeah do you think that all those people got to stay home during the lockdowns were like I really wish I could go to work today instead of sitting on my ass at home and getting a huge paycheck no they loved that and people stayed home with their kids especially the ones stayed home with their kids they stayed with homeschooling homeschooling shot up through the roof because they realized how much Superior that system was when they were allowed to do it uh then the system that they were indoctrinated into do people not get gratification from their work of course they do isn't it a part of who they are what identi what they have besides I'm woman I cook clean I'm same as all other women versus you can say I want to be an astronaut I want to be a political debater I want to be a podcast Host this assumes anything could ever possibly be more important than being a mother could you think of anything more important than that job I mean the president of the United States probably the president of the United States is is there to protect what the nation I don't know I'm saying mothers right and fathers so I can't think of a more important job for a woman an individual woman than being a mother what about being a father for an individual man why isn't that his most important job is an important job no obviously him going out and making money is more important than him being a father because because he's enabling the mother who has the most important job ever which is being the mother only she can be that to stay home with the kids a great privilege for her to be able to do that stay home with her own kids it she you don't get to decide whether or not that was a great privilege for her I'm not deciding that it whether or not it was a great privilege for this particular woman specifically I'm just saying that the fact that that can even be done in modernity I don't see how you could see it as anything other than a privilege for a woman to be able to do that sorry so if we could live in a communist Society where no one had to work and we could all live under like a government or a billionaire as the patriarchy wouldn't you want that aren't you saying you're against like productivity in society communism is the move towards a stateless society communism has the same impossib by the way Communists were the original feminists just so you know but um I am aware actually that yeah but just so you know communism suffers from the same hole in its logic as feminism which is enforcement communism is the move towards a stateless society and who's going to enforce it yeah I know but I wasn't making an argument I couldn't I was not AR argument is not logically possible so I can't even respond to the hypothetical it's not even logically possible what did I ask you again you asked me if you could live in a communist Utopia where nobody had to work and you know everybody was just paid equally I could I guess engage and say sure I'd love that if such a thing was possible but I don't even think it's actually logically possible because of the lack of enforcement so I don't even think that that's a valid hypothetical because it's just illogical it's not even possible okay it's like there's some hypotheticals which are not logically possible so they can be rejected H okay what what I meant though on a broader scale was this this seems to be a very anti- capitalist mentality to have half the workforce give a about capitalism it's not important to me oh but neither socialism that's wor and what you end up with with pure capitalism is crony capitalism we have we have a great tradition in the United States and globally especially in Europe of mercantilism and that's phenomenal that's a fantastic system oh okay yeah Merchants being able to freely trade barter and um you know I understand having a a currency like we have now but yeah I think it's a mercantilism will always exist it exists right now but capitalism has become crony I mean Cron capitalism is capitalism basically now so yeah not a big fan of how capitalism currently exists oh but it's still a better system than still a better system than socialism and communism well one's a mixed economy type of socialism and then there's like Socialist Communist no well socialism in its actual form is that the state has control of all industry and communism is a stateless Society so socialism is stage one all industry and Private Industry is owned by the state and then stage two how you told me on the last podcast that you would also consider before the um abolishment of the system that it would still be socialism if it's a mixed economy you said that I was a socialist on the basis that I believed on a mixed mixed economy but that's because the mixing that you want in the economy is the state own the means of production that's the problem so like healthcare for instance that's a state owning the means of production yeah but you just posited that it would be all of the means of production that's the end result I was saying there should only be some but socialists are going to start by socializing whatever industries that they can before they socialize the other Industries so but then I wouldn't be a socialist I would be a Social Democrat well no you'd be a socialist because you'd want to see all industry socialized no when did I say that I had told you that I wanted to see some industry socialized like healthcare all indust socialized I told you I believed in a mixed economy mixed how as in they're still capitalist facets of the economy like which ones what kind okay well I actually I honestly wouldn't even want to get into it because I don't even know what I'd say that's fair we have one chat here from IDK how to play Hey thank you man appreciate it I don't know what exens I don't know what that does any do you know what that is exens citizen oh maybe xans must follow the Bible Andrew believes in slavery atheists have morals we live in societies and determine the consensus eans believe in fic oh okay Christians believe in fiction good people don't need God to give them rules what makes them how do you know they're good what makes a person good they're not mean to other people how do why is that good um you literally said it yourself a categorical imperative categorical imperative was me pointing out what that meant not that I followed it I don't follow K and okay okay um treating people as means rather than ends that's another Canan principle yeah that's the C that's still the same one yeah but the the question still is what makes it good though what makes it good what's the justification of what is good and what is not good what makes something good what makes something bad other than preference what okay you're you're about to say like facts not feelings but here you're just saying like feelings versus Bible and in my humble View feelings are more tangible and real evidence for something happening than I'd say the Bible so what makes the thing bad is your feelings yeah how you feel about it if that's the case then if another person feels bad about things you feel good about then that would make you bad yeah and they're just as justified in that position as you yeah but that's why in every decision that we make we temper our utility versus how much it's going to harm other people and you I'd say what objective goodness ising to decrease the harm is still a subjective metric because what is harm to you may not be harm to him may not be harm to him may not be harm to him yeah but it's still less subjective than religion in my opinion just every bit because religion was just like one man decided and wrote it down this is everyone feels everyone feels the same way you can be empathetic towards anyone who has feelings you don't believe in objective truth [Music] um can you give me examples of objective truth that aren't religious yeah the laws of logic uh I don't know probably can the cup be a cup and not a cup at the same time can it be anything other than itself can the law of non-contradiction not exist um I don't know you don't know okay all right I just want to thank I just want to let you know that that's part of an argument for the evidence of God and while people pretend that there is none there is philosophical evidence I did say I was agnostic and not atheist fully all right I do want to thank smash Nitro who became a tier five uh member of the channel thank you man very much appreciate your support and patronage thank you man appreciate it we do have a chat here via streamlabs from one sec guys it's loading sleepy bear thank you man appreciate the streamlabs message selfworth is not to be tied is not be tied to your profession it is tied to your posterity elderly talk about their children not their jobs how you make money is meaningless your children have all meaning there could never be anything more meaningful than your own children what else could there be thank you sleepy bear very much appreciate it guys if you want get your last minute chats in I'd like to uh offer up for now if you'd like to each make a closing statement Andrew why don't we have you start yeah I appreciate you coming out tonight for this debate it was very uh very kind of you to do I hope you enjoyed yourself all right I'm not the vicious cruel evil bastard I have been made out to be at least not unless there's a panel full of dumb women then I become that evil rotten no good you know etc etc but I do appreciate the exchange uh your worldview is severely flawed but the one thing about you as you're no dummy I think that You' realized that there's some serious flaws there that you got to kind of work out but other than that I appreciated the good faith exchange thank you um yeah like I said I from the beginning I already felt like I was probably going to have trouble classifying My Views and I know a lot of people are going to say like oh why is she even like on this podcast first of all like I never said that I was an expert and like I don't know I kind of people just told me it was a dating podcast so I'm not claiming that everything I say is like absolute factual truth I'm just expressing my opinion and trying to make an argument without like hurting other people I don't know or just I like that I was able to have a discussion here and find out that I'm not a utilitarian okay has he changed your mind on anything Andrew or pretty still firm on beliefs um uh he's he's definitely made some points that I've had to concede to with my own views I don't think he's convinced me of any of his views but I think I definitely have to concede like on certain stuff like when I said that I wish that I was aborted or like the utilitarian thing I do think you you you did a pretty good gotcha there with that one so yeah I think there are points where I'd have to backpedal and concede that I don't make a perfect argument every time but I would still say I believe in my own views okay what if I was if I had delivered this entire thing the meanest way I possibly could think of but made the same points would you still have the same opinion un even though I would like I wouldn't be like I wouldn't storm out if you did that I think I would just be also very annoying to deal with and I don't think either of us would have made any productive discussion it would have been more entertaining should we do it like for five minutes you guys w't just go at each other no just kidding uh let's see we're going to uh couple quick things Nick could you pull up the twitch guys I hope you enjoyed the stream just
