Go to twitch.tv/w whatever and you can drop us a follow and a prime sub if you have one. Without further ado, we have a few topics and prompts for today. You will each have a five-minute opening statement where you will introduce yourself as you like. And then the rest of the show will be open conversation with some prompt changes and breaks for messages from the audience. And then you will each have a fiveminut closing statement and you're going to open. So, go ahead. My name is Raphael Gomez. I'm the host of Women on Men, where I interview women about men and dating. And here's my opening statement. I'm not here to fight men. I'm here to fight for them. Because the red pill is presented as medicine, but it's actually a poison. And peer-reviewed research proves it. Red Pill Amanda's fear content prays on angry, rejected men, and turns their pain into blame. It tells them women are the enemy, that dating is a war and they're losing. That feminism ruined everything. The very people they want to date become their adversaries. And it's easier to buy into that story than to look inward. But the science is clear. Studies consistently show that red pill communities promote hostile sexism, dehumanize women, and radicalize male pain into misogyny. And to top it off, it's not helping them date either. Men who endorse red pill beliefs report higher levels of loneliness, romantic dissatisfaction, and psychological distress. But the consequences are real and deadly. Just a short drive from this studio, Elliot Roger murdered six people at UC Santa Barbara with the manifesto filled with hatred for women. Don't do that. Don't do what? Don't do the manifesto. Don't do that for YouTube purposes. Like, just skip that part or maybe the point. Go ahead. Okay. and he became a martyr for red pill communities, a symbol of what happens when male pain fers into violence. For all the lectures about female nature and alpha dominance, red pill men aren't forming real relationships. They're staying single, bitter, and stuck. The more they consume this content, the worse their life gets. Not because women changed, but because they did. In the end, it leaves them lonely, angry, and blaming everyone but the ideology that failed them. Just this week, Andrew called red red pill creators degenerates for pushing casual sex, discouraging marriage, and obsessing over status. Yet, here he is today defending that same ecosystem. He also said that the divide between men and women is a good thing because he believes women will cave first. Andrew wants to keep that division wide because it serves his personal crusade to eradicate feminism, even if it means sacrificing the well-being of the very men he claims to protect. That's my opening statement. Okay. So, I'll respond a few things. By the way, my name is Andrew Wilson, the host of The Crucible. Uh, welcome to Well, actually, thank you guys for having me, especially the Whatever podcast chat. Always nice to be back with you guys and of course, the Crucible Crew. Uh, thank my opponent for coming out as well for this. Um, so the first thing is you mentioned that the the red pills poison uh and women are enemies, adversaries. I think that you're making a very classic mistake that many people make, which is that you're associating content creators and their views with what the red pill is. And so maybe we can get in what you think the red pill actually is. Sure. Um, so you say that um the red pills making men stay single and uh and stay miserable, etc., etc. Uh, we can get into that, too. Uh, I actually didn't say that red pillars were degenerates. And I'm guessing that you're referencing the Pearl Davis debate. Uh, no, you said this on your channel. You were talking to a gentleman on your own channel. I can't remember. He was talking on an iPad. You didn't like the sound. It was something you posted I think Tuesday. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, there are a lot of degenerates who are redpillars, but I didn't I wouldn't make the claim that the red pill to me is just a descriptive packet. Uh, and you say that Andrew wants uh, feminism to be destroyed at the expense of men. It's the opposite. I want feminism to be destroyed because I think that that protects and helps and assists men. So, I'm talking about a gender divide. Um what what I'm what I'm disassociating is that there needs to be when I say gender divide women in the role of female gender roles and men in the role of male gender roles. So that's the divide I'm looking at. Now I'm not looking at a divide of uh like men and women not being close to each other. I'm looking at the divide of I don't want uh sameness when it comes to gender roles because that's really bad and it does not suit society very well. So, um, kind of with that, I'm happy to just kind of dive into whatever you want here. Sure. Um, so I know you say the red pill is kind of this ideology, but red pill, not an ideology, whatever word you used. Um, it's a package. It's a data packet. I've heard you say that. I understand. Um, but the only way that message is really disseminated is often through these big content creators. Most of the people come across a red pill from things like Fresh and Fit, Andrew Tate, this channel. Um, it's that's how that package is distributed and there are prescriptive messages. How did they come across it? I don't know. The internet is the internet the algorithm. Do you think they made it up? Do I think who made it up that those red pill creators that you're talking about? Do you think that they just made all that stuff up? No, I don't. I think there's too many similar messages for it to be made up. Yeah. So, there's like sources for this stuff, right? Wherever they're sourcing it from, I'm not sure they're dissimating. One such source would be a guy, his name is Rolo Tamasi. Um, the godfather, the red pill. He's going to be pissed that I said that because it's like an ongoing meme. But um he calls it a praxiology, right? So if it's if it's praxiological from his perspective, he's saying there's no prescriptions here, right? It's not it's not designed around prescriptors, it's designed around descriptors. So if you're going to criticize the red pill, you should probably start by criticizing the descriptors. Um, but if you wanted to criticize individual content creators for their prescriptions, I think that that's fine. But that's not the red pill. The red pill is a data packet of descriptions which are trying to to express and explain interpersonal sexual dynamics between men and women. I think the gentleman you mentioned most people haven't heard of. Um, I think most people are getting heard of them. I think most of the people are getting their information from the millions of subscriptions to Fresh and Fit and whatever. and fresh and fit. He goes on often. They have a very close Myron Gaines, I'm sure, is much more popular than him. Yeah. Well, the thing is is like maybe, but Myron Gaines is not the Are you saying he's the red pill? I think he's one of them. Okay. So, what So, what is Let's start with that. What is the red pill? I consider it content that claims to reveal the truth about women but promotes misogyny and male victimhood. Okay. So, um you think that the descriptors do that? I think the content creators that are prescribing what the red pill is. It's not so it's not about So it's about content creators. Sure. You just think that So there's just content creators who you disagree with their message. Um the majority of the red pill content creators that disagree with their message. Well, okay, but okay. Well, what's the majority? Like how many do you think there are? The most popular of the bunch. The ones that have the most viewers, subscribers. Okay. So, who are these guys that you're talking about? Um Fresh and Fit is a big one. Andrew Tate is another one. And the Whatever podcast is another one. Fresh fit date and whatever. So here's an easy one. I guess let's start with whatever because I'm intric I'm pretty familiar with the content here. Um so what is the message that's being put out there? Um there's a lot of misogynist messages that come out of this podcast and I have Well, let's start with what is misogyny? Misogyny is the hatred or dislike of women. The active dislike of women uh plural women. Yeah, correct. The entire gender. So, not the active dislike of a woman. No, not typically. So, it's just women. Yeah. Okay. So, misogyny is the active hatred or dislike of women. Got it. All right. And fresh and fit is another big. Let's start with whatever. Okay. Yeah. So, what is the misogyny or the dislike of women which is promoted on this channel? Every the it's presented as a dating podcast, but it's really not. Um the topics that typically come up on this podcast that what makes it not a dating podcast? I'm about to go into that. Oh, okay. Go ahead. Um a dating podcast should not discuss whether or not women should be submissive, whether women should vote. On Sunday, Sunday's show, you ask women how many pumps after they tell you to stop is it grape. That's not a dating podcast. That's one of the craziest questions I've ever heard. Um you basically say divor divorce hurts men. Marriage is pointless. I don't know how that's helping your audience. I don't know how military conscription has anything to do with a dating podcast. I don't know how uh you know guests being shown a submissive ex-girlfriend and saying, "Would you bow to your husband? Would you bow to your husband?" That's not a dating podcast. That is promoting hatred of women and and misogyny as well. Um female guests are pressured to reveal their body count and then mocked. If they don't reveal, they're interrogated until they reveal. Um women with Only Fans are moralized and told to quit. Um, male promiscuity is excused and celebrated. Um, women are asked about their peak looks, age, and questioned incessantly. Segments like Man Bear versus Woods mock women's very real fears about male violence, even though statistical realities are ignored and and dismissed as irrational. Um, the super chat roast, um, the guests love to [ __ ] on these women every chance they get. And on this show, feminism and women are blamed for most of men's problems. Can I have a Do you have a copy of that? I'd like to see it the thing because you just shotguns a bunch of points. And Andrew, might you want it one by one? I also have peer-reviewed studies if you want those two. Yeah, if you have any especially if they have a meta analysis, I'd like to see them. And and just to be before you give your response, Andrew, my understanding here for the the debate was primarily going to be about feminism, not specific criticisms of the Well, I mean, this is prompts were about manosphere and red pill. Yeah. So, this is I'm actually fine with this. Right. So, um why it's not really a dating podcast. Whether women should be submissive. Um why I don't understand why would that not be relational to dating. What does submission have to do with dating? Well, because dating is a especially on a dating show, you would be significantly talking about people's preferences when it came to the the social experiences or having with the opposite sex. You're not talking about your preferences, you're talking about their preferences. Cuz when you talk about submission, you're talking about from your worldview, women should be submissive. Okay? But what from their worldview, they could also have maybe a counter to that why they shouldn't. Or uh also a lot of them say yes, they should. So, the idea here for submission especially would be I don't I don't see how that's not dating related. I I don't know how submission comes up on any sort of date. I don't know if you've ever been on a date in in the last So, okay. So, if I ask you, what type of woman do you want? Mhm. And you go through the traits and you say, "I'd also like a submissive woman." Does that make sense to say as a trait? Sure. I don't know many people that would just offer that up as one of the first things they want a woman, but maybe those are the people you hang out with. Who said it was the first? If you're if I'm asking you said if you ask somebody if I'm asking what's your dynamic and one of the answers is a submissive woman. Yeah. That comes up all the time for men in dating. Okay. In your circles perhaps. I mean no just in what it Well, how many dating podcast sample sizes do you have here? I listen I'm I'm on a dating podcast. I made one. I listen to a lot I listen to a lot of your shows. I listen to a lot of everything that's out there. I don't understand any of the dating podcasts that come up when you ask men their preference. They've never once said, "I would prefer to have a woman who's more submissive." The topic of submission only comes up on Red Pill podcast. No, it doesn't only come up on podcast. It's been on Dr. Phil. It's been everywhere. Dr. Phil talks about submission every episode. Every episode. I didn't say every episode. Doing a dating. Is he doing a dating podcast? Don't mention Dr. Phil as a dating show. Don't mention Dr. Phil mentioned. That's not a dating show. You asked where else it's mentioned as a dating show. That is not a dating show. Yeah. So in in in any case, any of the dating podcasts that I've seen is a very common answer to say that they want to name another dating podcast. And here's the other thing to dive into this. Name another dating podcast. Here's the other thing to dive into this. Well, you got to name another dating podcast. Okay. Fresh and fit happens there all the time. Red pill content. Exactly. As I said, okay, so when you're talking about a dating podcast, what do you mean by that? Something a little less, I don't know, misogynistic perhaps. What does that mean, though? I've already explained it to you and defined it. If any man has a has a dating podcast, is it uh red pill or I have a dating podcast and it's not misogynistic. I see. And let me ask you a question. What kind of questions do you ask on your dating podcast? I asked them what are their priorities in a man. I asked them, "Do you have advice for men and dating?" How many uh how many men have you had on? Zero. It's called women on men. Oh, I see. So, you're a misandress. Absolutely not. Well, I don't understand. Why don't you want a man's opinion? Because I want to ask women specifically. That has nothing. Missandry involves hate and I don't hate men. Oh, okay. I got it. So, so you only have on women, correct? And you don't ask them when you ask them about preferences. Yeah. Right. Do they say that they want things like assertive men? No. Do they say that they want less assertive men? I give them a list of 10 traits and say, "Rank these between your top three and your bottom three." Okay. So, you're you're giving them the answers. I'm not giving them the answers. They take a lot of time to think about it. But you just said you gave them 10 traits. Yeah, that that's not the answers. Those are options. Yeah, that's answers to that. There are options. you can choose from. It's a multiple choice. That's not answers. Yes, it's answers. Okay. They're answers, Andrew. Yeah. You gave them 10 answers and say, "Choose from these." And then they sort them. Yeah. But that doesn't mean that's their answer. You're making them choose from answers that you give them. So, you're literally feeding them their answers and and then they choose them. Yep. And they don't come and say, "Man, I wish you would have had this on the Why is it then?" Well, how long have you been doing it? Can we get back to Can we get back to misogynistic podcast? If it is the case that can we get back to misogynist the case that it is your criticism can we get back to misogynist if you're going to have criticism for whatever I'm going to have criticism for your podcast you haven't even listened to it so don't don't talk about it do I need to pull it to it from you go ahead pull it up on YouTube I can listen to it from you go ahead and pull it up on YouTube you have not watched my podcast so don't sit here we're not going to critique my podcast why not because you haven't even watched it let's watch it go ahead pull it up so if we pull it 45 minutes 45 minutes 45 minutes put on two times speed and then we can critique my podcast but until then tell me about another non-misogynistic red pill podcast. Well, I don't think any of those are misogynistic podcasts. Yeah, of course not. You got to demonstrate that they actually hate these women by their actions, by the things, everything that's happening right there. Yeah. So, so let's go through some more of these. When Myroning Gains has a has a a college uh table that says women deserve less. You don't think that's a little misogynistic? Is that during his podcast? He is one of the red pill content creators that we're talking about. I had to be a podcast, dude. I thought I had to be a podcast. doesn't have to be a podcast. Act like an adult. That is the most childish thing I've ever seen in my whole life. That's You put the You gave me the criteria. The criteria is the content creators, including my ring gains. Yes. I've always said that. Nothing's changed in my We're talking about dating podcast. The idea of dating. Correct. Is it also possible there's just not that many? Yeah. There's not a lot of red pill podcast. The No, no. Just dating podcast. There's a ton of dating podcast. Okay. Name some. Mine. Name some other ones. Um there's a guy named Man, We're in Trouble. Um there's um Eeveeit. There's uh Eevee edits a a dating podcast. Yeah, she talks about dating and men and women. Say a dating podcast though. Yes. So they have This isn't a dating podcast. Hang on. So they have This isn't a dating podcast. So on Eeveeedit they have uh every single time they come on they have multitudes of people on with them and all they talk about necessarily say they have guests. I'm not talking about the format. I'm saying that's what the content that comes up is men and women and this is not a dating podcast that we're currently on. You're just talking about for you a dating podcast. Just anybody who's talking about dating. This is not a dating podcast that we're currently on. Well, prove it. It's I just did. How? Let's go through more. You want me to read them? So, here. Why don't we do the first one? Whether women should be submissive, I don't I don't understand. How's Again, how would that not Yeah. Actually, how would that not be uh a decent question to ask for dating? I don't get it. Do you ask that on your first dates? What if a woman would be submissive? Yeah. No, exactly. Cuz it's not a dating question. Why would that Wait, hang on. Let's back up. Let's assume for a second that anything that I would ask a woman on the first date isn't something you would ask a woman on the first date. What does that prove? I'm saying the things you guys do. How do you think you're going to look better in 10 years? Do you think you're going to look better in 10 years? Is that something you ask on the date? What's your body count? Do you ask that on the first date? Can you answer my question? Do you ask what's a body count on the first date? Before Before you start shopping, you have different questions. Before you start any questions, you have different questions. I'll never answer one of yours if you never answer one of mine. Go ahead, Andrew. So, so here here we go again. What does it actually prove? What does it prove that if I asked a whole sequence of different questions from you on my first date? What does that prove? That you're not asking these questions on your first date? Can you answer my question? I just did. What does it prove? It proves that you're not asking these questions. So, it doesn't prove anything. It does prove it. What does it prove? That you're not asking these kinds of questions on your first date. So, what is that proving outside of that? It proves that these are more mis Hang on. Does it also prove that I don't ask any other questions other people would ask that you're not asking here? I have no idea if it proves anything. Like, it's just so stupid, dude. It proves nothing. What does it prove? What do those questions prove? Nothing. They don't prove anything. Okay. This is just a pure dating podcast. Dating is about your preferences, anecdotes, experiences. It's about how many pumps after she says stop is grape. That's a dating podcast. You think that when people Hold on. Answer that question. Answer. I'll answer it. I don't think you are. You have to stop talking. I can't answer it. So, stop talking and I'll answer it. Is it the case that when you have uh you know half a dozen people who are sitting at a table and they're building a rapport with each other that they crack jokes? You think that's a joke? Yeah. How many pumps after a woman says stop is it grape is a joke? Yeah. Who laughs at that? Uh, lots of people. I think it's funny. I I'm not surprised you think it's funny. I think you think it's funny. I'm sure you think it's funny. It is funny. Do you know But do you know why it's funny? What makes it funny? Cuz you're a little misogynistic. No, no, no. It's because a feminist on this program a few months ago. I remember. I saw it. Yeah. Yeah. So, I don't So, it's a call back to that. It's not a call back to that. Yeah. It's a call back to that because that was not about stopping. Yeah. It was about consent. Yeah. But that was about your wife sleeping and you banging her while she's sleeping. But that does if she says stop and you keep going. Is that consent? That Well, the idea there is how long after is is are you violating consent? That's the idea. Yeah. It's a dating podcast topic, right? Of course. No. Yeah. Of course. People talk about that all the time, right? Do you think that in the age in this modern age where interexual and interpersonal dynamics between men and women are so [ __ ] up and they are [ __ ] up and you're contributing, right? Do you think that the idea when you have tons of people who are out there talking about consent, you have feminist academics who are talking about if two people are drunk and they have sex, they're actually technically raping each other, raping each other, right? Do you really think that these are inappropriate questions to ask during a dating podcast in modernity? I absolutely believe it's inappropriate to say how many pumps after a woman says stop is it grape. That is inappropriate. Why? Because it should just be after she says stop. Tell me how many not going to answer that question. You're not going to answer it? No, cuz it's a stupid ass question. I don't know. I think it's a fair question. Of course you do. Cuz you're misogynistic. What's misogynistic about it? Because that is grape. You're talking about grape in such a lightarted manner. I just answered the question. How does that prove I hate women? Dude, we can go down the list of things you've said. Go down the list. Out of your 5,000 debates. Go down the list. Do you like women at all? Love them. Oh, you love them. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you know, it's so funny to talk about grapes. So funny. The fact the fact that you would laugh at a grape question shows that you don't like women. I laugh. Oh, hang on. Hang on. Are you saying I hate men because I laugh about prison grape? No. You don't hate I don't get it though. That's a double standard. You don't hate men. You don't You love You only care about men. So if I make light of a man getting raped you don't see that's that's fine you don't see it the same and it's not I don't how do I see it you tell me you see women is so much less than prove it I'm looking for the demonstration not the assertion just watch just watch the assertion just watch videos just watch Andrew's videos yeah exactly yeah don't prove no evidence yeah no I'm making it up I'm making it up so just tell me real quick how can you uh affirm that I hate women cuz I might make light of a grape joke for women, but I don't hate men if I make light of a grape joke for a men. I'm not sure. You know, I know you're not sure cuz that makes no [ __ ] sense. So, moving on to the next one. Um, as we go through this, uh, whether women should vote. So, in modernity, women's voting habits, right, uh, have a lot to do with the modern state of society, don't they? Sure. And they have to do with um with the state of of people who want maybe patriarchy or they want highly religious women who allow men to lead uh or women who will turn over their ability to vote to their own husband and say, "You just tell me where to vote?" Yeah. You agree with all of that? Sure. Okay. So then why wouldn't it be pertinent to ask women what they think about women's voting patterns and voting habits? Because you talk about revoking the right for women to vote. So, so it's just just an easy conversation people have. Should women vote? That's just something that people talk about around their dinner table, right? It's okay. Do you think that was an easy conversation when you were talking about whether or not it was okay for white women to vote to date black men? Do I think what was an easy conversation? That conversation. Sure. Pre premisination was pretty hard conversation, right? But do you think that it was pertinent to dating at the time? Sure. Okay. So then if that was pertinent to dating at the time and they were talking about all the reasons you should or shouldn't do this and it's a political and it's a political ideology both on both sides, right? Why is it not appropriate for us to have a conversation about women's voting patterns when it comes to relationships? It's not women's voting patterns. It's should women vote. That's not about patterns. Yeah, it is. That is the question about women. Well, how would you determine if they should or shouldn't? I just think everyone should. Oh, you just think that? Yeah. Tell me why. I don't need to. You don't need to. No. Okay. So, the thing is is um I'll I'll I'll just I'll just release you from this. I'll just let you skip out on giving me no justification for why everybody should be able to vote. I I don't I don't need What I want to know I would like to know. You don't need one. I don't need a justification justification. I don't need justification to ask a woman uh if if she thinks other women should have the right to vote in order for me to judge whether or not she's a submissive woman or not. Sure. But that's not a dating topic. That's just you being political. I want to judge if that's you being political. You guys push your conservative agenda on this channel and that's what you do. Do you think that I want to live in it? Well, I do. Yeah, you do. And so, Jim Bob, I know because homie just sits back and chills. Brian's chilling. He's eating popcorn while you ask these questions. Yeah, it's But I mean, I literally have made It's his podcast. I've never made any qualms that I'm here to represent my worldview. I know, but it's a dating podcast and you're asking these crazy questions. They're not crazy. They're absolutely. Should women vote is a crazy question in 2025. Can I also ask you this? Do you think that men and women get and when they're in relationships get into political arguments often? Sure. Constantly. Right. I mean, theoretically, if you're dating somebody with the same values, you're not. But if you marry if you marry a woman and she votes against your vote, would that create marital issues? Maybe. But I don't think you probably would have ever married that person to begin with because you don't have Probably not. You know why? Because you asked her what she thought about the right to vote and she said, "I want women to have the right to vote." And so he didn't [ __ ] marry her or he didn't date her because she doesn't align with you politically. Does that do you know do you know people that that do that? Do you know people that say I won't marry this woman because she thinks women should marry an overly assertive woman who thinks that she's going to be politically dominant in my home. Of course it has nothing to do about politically dominant. You said if I ask a woman, do you think women should vote? And she says yes. I'm not going to date that person. And then but hang on. But then you ask her why. No, I don't ask her why. I know. But if you were going to date her, you should. No, because I think women should vote. I know you think that you're not every man who lives. Wow. How many How many men don't think women should vote? I have no idea. But at least a significant think it's a significant amount. Yeah, I do. But give me a percentage of how I have no idea. Throw it out. You're a smart guy. That would be impossible. Throw it out. You're a smart guy. You can you can assume how many men throw out a number. Throw out a percentage in your gut, in your heart of hearts. How many men don't want women to vote? I'll throw that out. If you throw out how many do. Okay. Okay. You first. How many men want How many men want women to vote? I say at least 90%. Based on Man, I know. So, no. That's it. Yeah. So, based on anecdote. Exactly. Just like I'm asking you to do. Yeah. That's why I wouldn't give you one. Yeah. Because I don't deal in anecdotes. No. No. We don't deal on anecdotes at all. You deal in anecdotes all the time, but No, I don't. Unless you're asking me about something anecdotal. Okay. So, anyway, um yeah, there's no reason. There's actually no good reason that you've given me yet for why it's not pertinent inside of a man's dating life if he wants a submissive woman why he she wouldn't be politically aligned with his ideology. Okay. So, just pointing that out. You actually still haven't given me a reason. Yeah. On Sunday's show you asked, well, I didn't ask this, so I don't know anything about it. Um, how many pumps after a woman uh says stop before it becomes grape? Mhm. I didn't ask that. I know. But it's that's why this isn't a dating podcast because you made a joke. That's not a joke. Yeah, it's a callback joke. It's not clear to me that it's not. It's not clear because it's a totally different scenario. Okay. Even Even though you really don't think that that's about consent. I know what the joke was. I remember it wasn't debate. You're a joke. I'm talking about the call back. I'm saying this is not a joke. So So what makes it not a joke? Because it's not funny. Oh. So So you don't find it funny. So nobody find it funny. Nobody was laughing. Not a single person. So if I So if I go back to that time stamp and I look at it, go please do pull up and nobody's gonna say anything. Pull it up now. Nobody's gonna say anything. The only person that kind of chuckled was Brian. So then it was a joke. No. Then why did Brian laugh? I'm not sure. Cuz he thought it was funny. Perhaps if the joke teller thinks it's funny, that's that's a problem. Why? Because if no one else is laughing except the joke teller, that's a problem. That just means it's a bad joke, not that it's not a joke. Okay. It's so funny. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. But I mean, can people tell bad jokes? Sure. And nobody laughs. Yeah. Bad jokes about But if you tell the joke and then you laugh, do you think it was intended as a dating podcast? Yeah. Do you think it was intended as a joke? No, I don't. So why did he laugh? I'm not sure. Yeah, that's Maybe maybe out of awkward. Maybe out of insecurity. Maybe out of all Yeah, people laugh out in uncomfortable circumstances. You do it all the time. Like when I asked you why, you said because he thought it was funny. I Maybe it's insecurity. I have no idea. Maybe it's way your answer, bro. Oh yeah, I can change my answer. New information. How about that? You got It's your information. How is it new? The next one is divorce hurts men. Marriage is pointless. What? That literally the opposite of my message. No. Well, he's saying that's one of the reasons how the show is not a dating podcast. When we talk about divorce, you're actively promoting people. You're actively saying why should men get married? That's a common talk in point. No, I usually ask why secular men should. Why should anybody get married? This is super important. So this I don't even think you would argue that this is isn't dating related. So the span and spectrum between religious and the religious who want to get married in their preferences and secularists who want to get married in their preferences like [ __ ] night and day. And so I always draw this parallel out when I ask religious people why do you want to get married? Right? Especially religious women. And then you hear this answer right? you know, I want to fulfill my obligations to God or I want to, you know, live a certain lifestyle which is based on my ethical system. That's why I want to get married. You ask secularist women why you want to get married and often times they'll give you a whole complete class list of uh I want more resources or I would like security or they're not unreasonable, right? But they definitely have a completely distinct distinction in opinion for why they want to get married. That is I don't even think you could disagree that that's 100% valid for dating. Talking about marriage is fine. Discouraging it is not. When when do I ever This podcast discourages marriage all the time. When When have I ever discouraged marriage? I didn't say you did. I said this podcast. I have always maintained to try to throw you like as much banal ranch as I can. I've always maintained that to me I can't create justifications for secular marriage. Well, by the way, we're also talking about Red Pill Manosphere. Myron Gaines is also someone else. Another popular He also can't create. So I've had conversations with Myron about this. Okay. He also is in the same boat that I am in that for secularist men because what my says is from the religious standpoint makes sense especially if there's an ecclesiastical authority which can help govern it, right? Um but he's the same like from the secularist standpoint justifying it for men is very difficult. When he's talking about not getting married, he never caveats it about being secular. He says why would men get married? They don't get anything out of it. It's stupid. This is the same message that Red Pill content creators are promoting to their people and that's why they are seeking that's why they're alone and that's why they're isolated some ground here that um he probably does talk like that but he's a secularist. Okay. So when he's when he's referencing men right he's thinking of it from that view. What does Andrew Tate think about marriage again? What does that have to do with Myron Gaines? One at a time. Don't pivot. Don't red her. Wait. And also I just want to come in here. Andrew Wilson is not Andrew Tate. So why is Andrew doing a defense of Andrew Tate? He's doing a defense of Red Pill Manosphere content and that they are content creators of that. I'm fine. I'm fine doing this. So uh Andrew Tate is looking at things also from the perspective of um Muslim and um he's looking at things from he has a like a variance perspective that's kind of interesting. um discouraging. I actually understand why it is that secularists discourage marriage for men. Uh that makes sense to me and I actually understand why it is that Tate would discourage uh marriage for men as well. That also makes sense to me. But since his conversion, he actually seems to discourage it less, but says instead that there needs to be reforms and changes to the way that the laws are done so that men don't take as much risk in marriage. Okay. Okay, so going back to my opening statement, three of the biggest podcasts that promote Red Pill content, whatever, Fresh and Fit, and Andrew Tate, most of them, this excluding you and Jim Bob, discourage marriage typically. So that's my point that I've been making this whole time that you guys, this these content creators are discouraging men and women from getting together because it benefits them. But I need you to tell me this now, okay? I'm going to actually concede this point so that you can tell me why the [ __ ] that's bad for men. Do you think men shouldn't get together with women? I have no I would love to hear your justifications for why it is that secularist men ought to get married to secularist women. Go ahead. I think that red pill men, especially the incelss of the world, 95% of them report severe depression and they're lonely. So these kinds of podcasts promote people being alone and that is dangerous to men. You're right. But have you looked at the unaliving rates for divorced men? They're high. But you know how much higher? 80% of all on the lives 80% of all on the lives are men. 80% of all on the lives are men. And by the way, why didn't you throw in uh because you're only giving one side of this, right? I've read probably all of these studies. In fact, you can give me the list. I bet you I have. You have the list. Here's what's interesting. In the study that you're citing specifically, especially when it comes to unaliving studies. Yeah. Especially when it comes to unaliving. Which demographic unalives the most? It's those who cohabitate. The cohabitating men who are unmarried, right? They actually unal alive more than the men who are married or the men who aren't married, including these depressed men. And cohabitation seems to be like kind of the number one thing that secularists push, right? Go ahead and cohabitate. You can go ahead and live together. There's no reason for you to have any type of moral standards. There's no reason for you not to go ahead and move in with with your girlfriend. That's what they push. Do you know who's getting married more right now than anybody any other demographic? Who? College educated people. Yeah, that's true. Mostly secularists. So, I don't know what you're talking about. They're not secularists aren't pushing don't get married. What does that have to do with anything? This idea that you're saying secularists have this non-moral code where they're saying just cohabitate, it doesn't matter. That's not what's happening because they're actually getting married. Yeah, because women who are in college have access to much higher status men than women who aren't in college. College educated people are also getting divorce less. Yes, because you have the high status man that you want who has lots and lots of money. Yes, that's the way that works. The women are also making a lot of money. Do you know how No, not No. So, here's the thing that's so funny. Here's what you what you didn't include here. So when it comes to the middle, right, you're right that the the middle class, which I would argue, you're saying I'm right a lot, which which probably doesn't exist, right? I appreciate you saying I'm right. The thing that's so fun about making a concession to a point is that it makes it easier for me to destroy it. So here's what's funny about this. You are correct that the middle class does get divorced a bit less or I'm sorry, get married a bit less, right? Um, in some cases a lot less depending on depending on what's going on. But here's why. You can only usually get a guy or a woman based around the social dynamics and social circle that you're in. Right. Sure. They don't they only have access to women or men who are roughly making around the same amount or not the same amount as them. And usually they meet them at work. College educated women different. Now they have access to this kind of wider pool of much more wealthy men, right? And so yeah, of course, of course they marry them more often. They have a higher status there for them to go after. That's why they do that. I like how you think women are just going after high status men when they make up 45% of the workforce, 43% of entrepreneurs. They're making their own money in Can you tell me though what the disparity is between the amount of money that these college educated women make compared to their college educated husbands? Sir, I'm not sure. But yeah, you're not sure. I'm not sure. Oh, that's such a shock. Well, let me tell you cuz I am sure. Right. A significant It's a significant amount. Give me a number then if you know so much. number because I don't remember if it's between I don't remember if it's between.5 or one but it's at least at least.5 more. Okay. At least. Okay. So like I don't I don't even know what you're here. Yeah. I'm arguing here that secularists still get married and you're making the stupid point that they're promoting cohabitation even though that's not I would say that if it were the case that the middle class had access to the same amount of wealth as the college educated women do that they would be getting married at the same rates to those men. Okay. Okay. Well, why aren't they getting married then? Because they don't have access to those men. Okay. Can you tell me why that's wrong? I think No, you can't. Can you? Cuz it makes sense, doesn't it? I'm about to. Why do you think there's such a gulf between relationships right now that you actually encourage? I don't. What golf do I encourage? You encourage it on Pearl Davis's show just this week. What? That the golf she said men and women are dating. You said good. Yeah. No. No. No. No. Are you serious? Yeah. Yeah. You're You're going to lie right here. Right in front in front of my face. I don't think I did say that. Yes, you did. You said it's good because they're going to No, I'll tell you what you said. You said they're going to hold out because you think women are going to cave first so that we could start creating these gender roles again. Ah, yes. So, you're talking about my internal critique of Pearl Davis. Pearl Davis said men and women aren't dating and you said good and this is why it's good. That's not an internal critique. This is why it's good. That's not internal critique. Yes, it was. The entire conversation with Pearl was an internal critique. That specific conversation was not an internal critique. The whole conversation was an internal critique. That's a That's a very likely story. It's not only a like but listen do you do am I do I am I a person who debates utilizing internal critiques? Sure. Yeah. And do I use that? Am I do I have a staple for utilizing internal critiques? Sure. Okay. Why is it though that for some reason you think with Pearl Davis I wouldn't use internal throughout the I will admit throughout the podcast you were. But this specific point you weren't. This was this was your own personal belief that it's a good thing that men and women are dating because you only want Christian people dating. You only want Christian people dating and having babies suck and go [ __ ] themselves. My point there if I now this is off the top of my head right and I think it's unfair for you to hold me to the standard of this debate that I had that went on for hours. I can't remember every detail of it, but if I remember this correctly, what actually happened there was we were discussing secular marriage and if the gulf got too wide, right, then people are going to divert themselves over to other ex thing. But I don't remember had nothing to do with secular. It's like you keep throwing that word in front of what these people are saying because it just helps your argument. But that's not what you guys were discussing. You're talking about men and women aren't dating. You admit that men and women are dating currently that it's Do you know men 18 to 24 never ask a woman out in real life? Did you know that? Yeah. No. Well, no, that's not correct. Okay, correct me then. Yeah. No, show me show me the show me any data that shows that in your packet. It's probably not in that packet because it's not true. Okay, then what's the what's the statistically? I don't have to give you a counter. I just can tell you that that's not true unless you demonstrate. Demonstrate it. Okay. I'm the one who actually brought something. Did you bring Did you bring any demonstrate any statistic you've thrown out? What statistic have I thrown out? Demonstrate any statistic you've thrown out. What statistic have I thrown out about how much more men in college make than their their wife counterparts? You demanded that I give you a number. What did I say? I don't actually significantly know other than it's significant. The gap. Well, then show me the proof of that. Yeah, I don't. That's all I [ __ ] up. Yeah. So, here here, just real quick. Just demonstrate it. Demonstrate it. I got your data packet. Let me ask you something. Are men and women dating less? Hold on. If you got to answer his question answer questions. Hold on. If you're going to cross-examine him, he's going to cross. I asked him initially how many people are dating. answered most of your question. What was the question? He said, "You've asked a bunch of You've shotguned a bunch of questions. He asked you a question back. You should respond." Oh my god, this [ __ ] room is cooking. Can you open that door up? It is pretty hot in here. Yeah, it's [ __ ] cooking both of them. Holy [ __ ] This is like peak bad, dude. All right. It's It's got to be like a [ __ ] 100 degrees in this room, dude. Uh, so anyway, where were we? What were we talking about? I asked about men and women dating and the gulf between them. Yeah. What about it? Do you admit that that's happening? That there's a gulf between dating? Yeah. That men and women are dating less by in general. What does that mean? What are you asking me? Do you think men and women are dating less? Yes or no? Yes. And you think that's a good thing? Um, contextually it could be a good thing. What do you mean by contextually? Well, it could be that people are selecting for better better mates, for instance, and so they're dating less because they have much more criteria for them to go off of. Maybe it you could possibly see these results of that less single motherhood. There could it could be a good thing. Do you think there are more in involuntary celibate men than ever? No. You think this is definitely not you think this is not an anomaly that's happening right now? No. When when else in history do you think that was happening? So throughout most of history, only about 40% of men ever reproduced. And we know this because of we can we can check our ancestry and see how many more uh female ancestors than male we have. So yeah, most men were not able to reproduce. They were expendable. They were used as soldiers, used as this, used as that. Uh so no actually resources to reprod. Yeah, you'll concede that point, right? So yeah, I don't think that this is like So you don't think there's a golf in the mail loneliness thing? You don't think that's a real thing? Yeah. Well, I didn't say that though. What did I actually say? No, I'm asking. Do you think it's So what I actually said was I do I do think it is the case that no, you are incorrect and that this is not the worst it's ever been. I would say that the interpersonal sexual dynamics might be the worst they've ever been. But I also think that feminism and single mom caused that. That's an interesting Why do you think that caused it? Because all the stats show that uh every single rate that you can imagine a metric which is horrific on young men uh usually comes from single mother homes. We're talking everything from homelessness on up. Um, are almost everything. Is another term for single mother homes, fatherless homes? Sure. So, why do you put it on women? Because it's usually women who initiate being in the fatherless relationship, not men. And why do they initiate being in a fatherless relationship? The number one answer from women is that uh irreconcilable differences. So, do you know anyone in a woman in your life has ever been divorced? Sure. Do they say, "Hey, we got divorced because we couldn't reconcile our differences." Or do they say another reason? Uh usually well I mean they they have all sorts of reasons. Yeah. But they don't say we couldn't reconcile our differences, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's true. But what's your point? Why do you use that as a reason women are That's the reason they give is irreconcilable. That's the reason they give in court. But what do they give in real life? What's the real reason? They have a varying varying uh degree of things. But here's what's not happening. What they're not actually giving in real life is he was abusing me. He was beating me up. He was doing this. He was doing that. You know the top three reasons women file for divorce. Infidelity, emotional neglect, and poor communication followed by finances. What's the top three though? That's the top three I just said. No, it's not. Yes, it is. No, the top three is not infidelity. Yes. Infidelity, emotional neglect, and poor communication followed by finances. Oh. So, what's the number one reason? I just said fidelity. Infidelity. I just said that. Infidelity is number one reason. Correct. Okay. Which one of these studies proves that? Did you bring any studies? Just tell me which You know what? Don't say any facts for the rest of this debate if you're not going to show me a study. How about that, bro? Listen, don't show No more facts. No more facts. You got to stop interrupting him every time. You literally were interrupting his boy. Yeah, you did. Did I make the claim or did you It's called Yo, it's called moderating the show. You've been interrupting the entire time. If Andrew interrupts you, I'll say the same thing to him. Yeah. But just real quick, um, did you make the claim or did I make the claim? I made the claim. Okay, great. Can you show it? I don't have the data point in front of me, but I looked it up prior to this and you can do it after. Okay. What if we do it now? Do go for it. Sure. And where can I find this data? I around. Yeah, you looked it up. I have a lot of data, man. I don't know exactly each source I got from this is more about single mothers. You can look at that one if you want to talk about single motherhood. Yeah, we can get into that. But again, this is just wild to me. I thought I thought you were going to tell me that that was the number one reason. Okay. Well, you can't use any facts if you don't have any data. The number one reason that I'm seeing is lack of commitment. Well, that's infidelity and also and also emotional neglect. Okay. What does lack of commitment mean to you, Andrew? I have no idea what it means. You tell me. That's not infidelity, right? Because infidelity doesn't show a lack of commitment. Does infidelity show a lack of commitment? So, not coming home by [ __ ] 10. What? What are you talking about? So tell me, what does that mean? Lack of commitment. You tell me. I You're the one who made the claim. You're the one who said it was irreconcilable differences. That's the number one reason they file divorces is right. But that's not the reason people actually file for divorce. Okay. So the reasons that they give you're saying that the number one reason women women give is infidelity. Infidelity, emotional neglect, and poor communication. Okay. Where can I find the statistics? I don't remember, man. I I brought all the statistics. You didn't bring any. I didn't need to bring any. Yeah, cuz you're making [ __ ] up. What am I making up? Anything you say? Cuz I can you can't prove it. What have I said that I made up about the the finances that did how do I make something up when I say I don't know for sure. Okay. Well, you said it's significant. That is true. It is significant. Okay. Well, how can you prove that? Well, what does significant mean? Uh let's see. Statistically, let's just see if we can find this. I am not seeing infidelity is number one answer on any of these. Okay. Um [Music] Number one reason I'm seeing is financial problems. That's not the number one reason. And you've also said it's not the number one reason. That's what I'm seeing. Okay. But I'm ready for a counterfactual. Okay, fine. Let's just concede that I don't know what I'm talking about. The point is it's not irreconcilable differences. People file for a reason. Well, we're talking past each other because you we were talking about divorce and I said that that they file for irreconcilable differences. You asked for the meaning behind the irreconcilable difference. I'm fine with that. I just don't think it's infidelity. I think that's incorrect. And when I just looked, it is. You made the claim that it is, but you can't tell me where I You're blaming women for filing for divorce, making it sound like it's just some fly by the night thing they decided to do. There's typically a reason. And you read something. I'm not saying that there's not reasons. Okay. The question then why do you blame women for single mother? The question The question is whether or not there's good Well, first of all, can you be a single mother and never be married? Sure. But where's the father in this scenario? Yeah. Well, here's the thing. Don't courts adjust towards women even when they aren't married. Do you know one in three children born out of wedlock don't see their father past the age of three? Did you know that? Why? You tell me. I'm I'm I'm waiting. No, you tell me. If you Why do I need to tell you when I ask you a question? Why? Because single motherhood is not just a female problem. Okay, but why do they not have access to Because men tend to abandon children. Can you demonstrate that? I think I just did. How? 33% of children don't see their father past age three. But that doesn't prove that it's because the men don't want to. Okay. How many men file for custody of the child in a in child court? Uh I don't know the stats off the top of my head. We can look. 95% of them are filed uh without contest from the father. And the 4% that do typically do get it. So if 95% of men aren't fighting for their child, I think you can look at men for the problem. Oh, I see. Okay. So, let's back up. Um, tell me something. Who can actually have children? Men or women? Women. Okay. Are these women being raped? No. Okay. So, they have uh the responsibility of making sure that they don't get pregnant, right? I think two people have the responsibility to make sure they don't get somebody pregnant as Do you agree with me that it is the case that most men will sleep with most women, but most women won't sleep with most men? So what? So if that's the case, right, then women have greater access than men do, don't they? Sure. So So if that's the case, why are they granting access to men who abandon their kids? How do they know they're going to abandon their kids? Well, hang on. That's so weird, though. Wait a second. Let's back up. Mhm. They they're the ones who have the sexual access, right? So if they don't if they don't know, why are they sleeping with these men? They're the ones who get pregnant, not the men. And men are the ones that get them pregnant. Yeah. So what? They're a part of the equation. So what? That's a part of the equation. Yeah. But women are the ones who get to access that. And men are the ones that access it. Okay. Can men can men have abortions? No. Can men force women to have abortions? No. Do you believe women should be able to have abortions? Well, if that's the case, right, that you believe women's women ought to be able to have abortions. Men ought not to have any say on whether or not women have abortions, then women are the ones who ultimately have 100% access around reproduction, not men. So, men have no responsibility in your eyes. How could they have a responsibility if they're not allowed to make the choice of if the child's even here or not? If you got somebody pregnant, would you abandon them? Do I form a secular worldview or do I form a Christian one? Do Christian people abandon their children? No. No, they don't. All All Christians are perfect. No, no, no, no. Under Christian ethics, you're not to abandon your children. Sure. Okay. So, only secular people abandon their children. No, that's not what I said. What did I just say? Christian ethics bans you from Under Christian ethics, you're ought not do that, right? Is ought not the same as do they don't. Should anyone do that? Do Do I think so? Yeah. Under Christian ethics, no. Even secular, do you think people should even if you're secular Christian ethics? I don't think secular people should. And I think secular people also don't think they should abandon their children. So, what's the point? But they can kill them. I don't think it's killing. Oh, I know, right? So, you don't think it's killing? No, it's not. It's not. Okay. Got it. They say kill them, but they think that they shouldn't have. It's a horrible framing. That's a horrible. A great compelling reason here. If the idea is that um that these women, they're get they're getting knocked up. They're the ones who have complete and total access to who sleeps with them. They're not getting raped. And they have the choice as to whether or not they abort or not abort. Yeah. But someone also wasn't. But does the man have a choice? The man was the man has a choice to not impregnate a woman. Now the man has a choice to not Does the man have the choice to keep the baby? Not if the woman does the man have the choice to make the woman pay him child support and keep the baby. How much is the average child support? Can you answer my question? I just went no answer my [ __ ] I just I just said no. Okay. Okay, let's back up. How about then? How about you listen? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's back up. Well, I said can you answer my question and you said no. You can see how I could perceive that as you saying, I'm not going to answer your question, right? Yes. No, even the moderator thought that was the case. Okay, so let's back up. You do believe that it is the case that men can't force women to have their children. Correct. But women can force men to take care of their children. That's correct. Okay. How is that fair? I'm not saying it's fair. Okay. So then what is the ins? So then if men didn't want to have that child, why should they be held to account take care of it? Because it's their child. What? Because it is their child. I'm super confused. But they didn't have a say. Doesn't matter. It's their child. Should they be able to have a say? I don't think so. But you just said it's not fair. Yeah, it's not fair. So what? They had a child. That's their child. They should take care of it and not abandon it. So, okay. So, to get this right, then women should be able to kill men's children if they want. Right. Stop framing it as killing or hang on. Or keep them if they want. And the man has to pay child support for the child. That's correct. Right. That's correct. And and you think women should get to make that choice? 100%. Why should we let the women make that choice? Because they're the ones that have to, you know, conceive. So, Got it. So, they're the ones have to conceive. So, they're the ones making the choice. Yep. So, therefore, it's their responsibility. Anything else? No, because the the father is also part of the responsibility. Wait, I I'm sorry. Who's making the choice? They can have the child, but the father should take care of their child. And you don't disagree with that, do you? Do you disagree with me or not? Do you disagree with the from a secular angle? Why not? Because it makes no sense to me. It makes total sense. If you have a child, you should take care of it. Well, let's try this again. I just walked you through the logic, though. [ __ ] the logic. I'm asking you. Do you think Do you think a secular person should take care of the child that they have? Does a Christian think that? Of course. And you don't think secular people do? Well, I can't see how a secularist could justify it. No. Not if you're making the claim. So, you made the claim here. From my worldview, if you have a child, you should take care of it. Period. Why? Because that's my worldview. Why though? Because it's your child. You are part of it. I don't need to justify it for you. Because when we walk around the logic, here's what we end up with. You say women have complete and total access. Should be able to kill a man's kid, right? Or should be able to bring it to bear and make sure that the man takes care of the kid, but the man can't tell the woman that she has to have the kid even when she's pregnant. Right. That's correct. And if there's a child in the world that that man contributed to, he should take care of it. Okay. So, just to make sure that we got this right, it's an uneven standard for men versus women. If that's the world we live in. Yeah. So, justify why it is that men shouldn't say [ __ ] that. I don't need to. Okay. Well, then when you ask me, Andrew, don't you think X? And I say, well, you say I can't say from a secular point of view. I say from a secular point of view, I actually can't answer the justification. Just remember that neither can you. And I would say most secular people also believe you should take care of a child if you're the one. From the Christian ethical angle, of course. Of course, you're supposed to take care of your children. But from the Christian ethical angle, it's also completely appropriate, right, to put significant pressure on women to not have abortions, meaning men get a say in the choice, right? Well, what's wild to me is that you're complaining about single motherhood and then you're sitting here saying, "Well, men should say [ __ ] it." Which is just wild that men should say [ __ ] it if they want. What did I say when you said so men should say [ __ ] it, right? I'm sorry. Do you know what an ought versus a descriptor? What's an ought? Ant is I don't know. Did I say that secular men ought do that or did I say I can't I can't think of a justification. You can't think of a justification. Neither can you. But you also don't think single motherhood is a good thing. Correct. That's correct. So why don't you encourage men to take care of the children? Should we force them to? I think so. Okay. So you think that we should force men to take care of the kids? Correct. That's what child support is. But no, no, no, no, no. That's not Well, that is true that they take it by force, I guess. Yeah, that's what you said. But what I'm talking about force is like should we make them participate as a father? Yes, we should force that. And so as long as the court rules that they should, yes. No, that's that's different. I'm not asking about what the court rules. I'm asking, do you think we should force men to participate? I think they should force at least child support. And if No, that's not my question. Well, that's what I'm saying. Should they force men to participate in being a father? Being a father? No. No, no, no, no. Not at the father. If the father is going to be a shitty father, then no. Then can you explain to me how it is that if the woman can get child support from the guy, right? And you were not going to force any participation, aren't you pushing single motherhood? No, you're blaming women for single motherhood. And and you're you're saying they're the ones who have all the choice by your own admission. But the fathers have no part to play in it. And in single motherhood, fathers have no part. Fathers can't make the determination as to whether or not they can even have the kid and only the woman can. You you hold an uneven playing field. I have at least a consistent view that women should not be allowed to abort and men ought to actually be made to participate in their own children's life. That's my consistent worldview. Your worldview is inconsistent. Okay. You're making said that if a man has a child, you're just giving privilege to women. If Sure. If a man has a child, they should take care of it. Do they? That's a different story. I'm saying they should. If women have children, should they take care of it? Yeah. Can they give it up for adoption? Sure. Okay. Can the man make the woman give or why can't the man give up his parental rights and just walk away? If the woman can. If the woman does, then he can. Well, wait, that's really weird. I don't get it. If it is the case that the mother has guardianship of the father's child, she can still put the child up for adoption, right? Sure. Okay. But he can't. If he has guardianship of the child, he can't. If he has guardianship, well, so he can, too. But if she's a single mom, what gives him guardianship? Well, he doesn't have guardianship. I'm saying if if if a father has guardianship, he can also put up the child for adoption. It's not just a mother. Yeah. But who does it default to? Why does it default to women? Because that's the way the system is set. How is it set that way? Because it's it it has become matrinal rather than patrineal. What does that mean? What does that mean? It means from the father, from the mother. No, I know the definition. You always need those words. But why is the family court? Why is it giving it? Because feminists have made huge pushes in order to make it that way. Feminists have pushed that women get custody of the child. Yeah. Are most judges in family court men or women? In family court, they're men and so they're influenced by feminists. I'm sorry. Wait a second. Are you saying that men can't be feminists? I'm saying that I doubt that the majority of family court Are you saying that men can't be feminist? I'm saying that I doubt all the family court judges are so influenced by family court judges have to adhere to the law or do they make the law? I'm not sure if they make the law or not. They have to adhere to the law. They don't make it. Right. Yeah. So family court judges are just adhering to the law. Right. And what's the law say? Yeah. The law you So here's what happened. We used to have what are called kovature laws. Covature laws actually forced men to take care of their families. That very same thing that you want. Right. Of course, this also made children their property and women, right, were also part of the man then, right? That was how it went. But guess what? They had to take care of their family or they went to [ __ ] jail. That's what happened. Marriages stayed together about 90 95%. And you know what happened? Feminists really pushed real [ __ ] hard for the average default laws. And here's what the average default laws were. Oh, the average default laws were saying basically on average the default is going to go to women. Right now, there's a whole series of laws I can pull up and go through, but yes, this was pushed by feminists. So that there was default laws which pushed pushed literally that women default by default had custody. Yes, that is correct. That is not how it works because if a father if a father tries to get custody of the child, they often do get it. But but most so feminists have failed then. No, bro. There's been since men's rights movement started, especially in about the mid200s, there have been reforms to the laws. Male custody has quadrupled because of men's rights advocacy groups. And yes, quadrupled. And yes, I can grab you that stat if you want. I'm not saying it has quadrupled because these laws have now begun to get rolled back. But it used to actually just be a straight default. A straight default. How long? Because I my understanding of this is most fathers aren't filing for custodial guardianship of the child. You're talking you have to understand that you're looking at it from a historic prism that doesn't make any sense. You're talking about modern laws and the way that modern custody arrangements happen. It wasn't always this case. The case used to be actually that children went to the men. That was the that was the old laws under coverture laws, right? that changed with feminism and radical feminism pushing for those laws to be changed. So you're saying there was a time when the children were raised there were more single fathers than single mothers. No, there just wasn't really any erosion of marriage. Okay. Then why did you say that? Why did you make that point? You made the point that back in the day men were getting custody of the children, but then there were still more single mothers. No, there wasn't very many single mothers either. Okay. But they outnumbered the single fathers. No, there wasn't. There you listen, these marriages stayed together, but under the law, it was true under the kovature laws that the child was the property or was at least associative property to the father. Yes. I'm glad we're having this discussion cuz it goes back to the point that I've been trying to make that. Can you explain though your logic there? I'm trying to understand the logic. No, I I want to get back to the thing we're talking about. No, no, I want to get back to the thing we're talking about. Hang on, hang on. I'm not hanging on. It's not about escaping. Before I let you escape, I just want to get back to this logic. This is the point that I'm trying to make. Why would it be that there was more? Hang on. Stop. I don't want to. I just want to finish. I want to get back to the thing. If you answer this last question, I don't give a [ __ ] I want to get to the next thing. Why won't you answer my question? Because the whole point I've been trying to make this whole debate is any chance you get, you blame women. Any chance you get, you blame women. Single mothers for what? For everything. You blame women for the downfall of society. What if it is that? Let me ask you this. You blame Do you blame women for the downfall of society? No, I don't blame it for the downfall of society. The current trend of society. You don't? No, you never said that. No, what I blame women for specifically, right, is feminism and feminist Marxist ideology. I do blame them for that. Yes. Okay. And as you said, feminism is the reason there's so many single mothers, right? I think it's a core reason. Yeah. Okay. So, is that contributed to the downfall of society? Sure. So, through that logic, women are contributing to the downfall of society. Yeah. But men would also be contributing the downfall of society. Okay. So, you blame women mostly for the downfall of society. You blame feminism. Yes. the ideology of feminism which I'm blaming the ideology. So you're just asking about the execution. It's like are you blaming men for the downfall of society of a society which is mostly communist or would you be blame because they're enforcing everything or would you be blaming the ideology? You're blaming women. Can you answer my question? No, you're blaming women. You're not blaming the ideology because women are the ones who So I'm going to ask the question again until you answer it. Okay. So you have a communist country, right? And the men are are doing most of the bad stuff in the communist country. Would you blame the men or would you blame communism? I don't think feminism can answer my [ __ ] question. Answer the question. Yes or no? You don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Start answering that. I don't know. Because you're saying feminism the ideology in its own. Feminism the ideology on it. You lived in a communist country and it was mostly the men enforcing the communism. You don't know if you'd blame the men or the ideology. Really? You don't know. I' I'd probably blame the men at that point. You blame the Okay. Well, then then So, you're saying that I should blame women? No, I'm saying that you do. I blame the ideology. No, you're blaming the women every chance you get. The only consistent thing you could actually say here would be, I blame communism for the way these men are behaving. Unless you innately think men are bad. What about feminism? Unless you innately think ma men are bad. What about feminism is bringing about the downfall of society? You mean what what is it contributing to? Yeah. It's not just contributing to single motherhood. It also contributes to these two-income households. It's contributing to well, it contributes to the fact that we even need two inome households. But one of the major things it contributes to is taking mothers out of the home. That's the biggest way that it contributes to the downfall of society is taking mothers out of the home. Don't you agree? I don't agree. But this this goes to the point that I said how does this change what I said that you blame feminism for the downfall of society? It well you didn't say that. You said I said I said that initially and I said that in my opening statement as well. blame women who who implemented feminism. Yeah. So, well, that was a bunch of rich corporatists and then and then it was also a lot of women who were in bed with No, it really was. It was rich corporatist. Was it men that implemented feminism? It was both. Okay. Yeah, it was both. But what do you think I But back to this, I just I just want to make sure, right? Why would it like how would it even track that I would blame women for the I or or hate women? I'm sorry. Hate women. I do blame them if they're feminists for holding that ideology, but that's not all women. That's not me hating women. You made the distinction earlier that if I hate an individual woman, that's not that's not misogyny, right? I wouldn't say on an individual level, no. Yeah. So then if I hate all feminists, that's only hating individuals with an ideology, right? If most women are feminist, wouldn't that be misogynistic? I'm not sure that most women Well, I don't know. That's hard to say. But if it is the case, no. Actually, even if it was the case that most women were feminists and you hated fe all all women who were feminists, you still wouldn't hate women. You would only hate feminists. That's an easy way out of that one. Well, I mean, it's true though, right? No. No, it's not true. Okay, then explain the logic to me because if women are feminists and you hate feminism, then you hate women. No, no, you hate feminism. Okay. Yeah. So, here's the thing and I can prove it. I hate men who are feminists, too. Oh, you're looking at one. Yeah. So, so here's the thing. If that's the case, then would that make me a misandress? I don't think so. What if most men were feminists, which you said it's about 80%. So, then I hate 80% of men by that logic. So, I'm a misandress, right? If you hate them for that, for that. Yeah, sure. Okay. So, then I'm a misandress and a misogynist. Then, yeah, you hate So, I just [ __ ] hate everybody. I mean, I wouldn't say most [ __ ] hate everybody. I wouldn't say most men are feminist. You said 80%. I I'm granting your hypothetical. You weren't granting a hypothetical. You I asked you the question. You said 80% agree with me. No, I don't think men I don't think 80% of men are feminists. Okay. How many? I don't know. I have no idea. I'll throw out a number. I'll say maybe 30%. 30%. Yeah. And how many women? Um I have no idea. Maybe 80. So, a lot more. Yeah. And you think that that shouldn't come up during a dating talk, huh? I'm not saying it should. I'm saying that you feminism which which by default you blame women. So if women are in the workplace men and women are so ideologically split on like almost a a like a 60/20 playing field you don't think that's pertinent to dating. I'm not saying that. I'm saying that you blame feminism for the downfall of society. I not not just feminism. Okay. Yeah. But I do blame feminists for their part of the downfall of society. Yeah. Including going to work, including going to college, including all No. idea of separating mothers from children. That was the worst idea. By going to work and going to college and that's a that's a terrible idea, right? Don't you think it's a better Who? Well, like why is it a better idea for you to send your kid to away from you to like a [ __ ] nanny or something to raise the kid instead of you? How's that better? I don't know. Move on. You don't know. Well, you can. Do you want to give a response before? Just cuz cuz it's not [ __ ] better, is it? I'm not going to get into that. Yeah, cuz it's not better, is it? I'm not going to get into it. Yeah, cuz it's Is it better though? Is it better? Is it better to send your kid off the [ __ ] Canuela? Who knows? Maybe it's better for that family. I have no idea. You You're making these big broad generalizations about how life should know. Do you think maybe for some families average that it would be better if mothers raise their children or outsource the raising of their children? They're not outsourcing it. Maybe it's for part of the day, Andrew. They're outsourcing. That's not outsourcing it because there's still the rest of the day. Okay. So, how much time on average is it that you think that mothers are spending with their children in comparison to how much they used to spend with their children before they were in the workforce? I have no idea. You don't know? No. What if it What about throwing one of those numbers out? What would you What would you think? Well, how about this? How about just make it easy? More or less? Less. Less. They're spending less time with them now, right? Do you think that that's good? I think each individual family has their own. Do you think that that's good? I think each individual family has their own. You think it's good for society? Others are spending less you think. Okay. Got it. Got it. Well, we'll come back to that. We do need to let a couple chats come through. We have quite a few who have collected. So, we have Nasha Nabu. Thank you. Appreciate it. Nashu Nabu donated $200. The lead attorney, a divorce attorney, speaks on why men do not fight for their kids. Judges go off precedent. Because of this, lawyers tell fathers not to fight for their kids because they lose. H, you know, I don't even I don't even want to grant that. Like, I don't even think you need to grant it. If the idea is just that women are completely in charge of all reproductive rights, period. Um, and you can't justify why men need to take care of their [ __ ] kids, then who gives a [ __ ] If I can respond to that, um, quick response if you can. Yeah, the majority of fathers that do contest tend to get, uh, their child, at least in modern times. Okay. Uh, Nshu, appreciate that. We have uh son coming in. Thank you. Offson donated $100. Thank you. This guy is a hypocrite. Critiquing Andrew for pushing a world view when he does himself. This guy can't make any prescriptive statements. He is a progressive feminist. This reduces to Emma preferences. To my preferences. Yeah. My I came here to say let's try to get men and women dating again, but we ended up talking about single motherhoods. Okay. Well, let's let's get into that. Let's get let's go. Let's get through a few more chats, but we can come back to it. Um uh son, appreciate that. We have stream. Thank you, man. Stream rift donated $100. Women will lie, cheat, and steal to hurt a father by fighting over custody. The question shouldn't be why men don't fight for their kids. It's why do single moms make them fight to begin with? If you care about your kids, you'll fight for them. I don't care. I don't care the obstacles. Because my opponent over here demonstrated it for you. Women should have the complete and total right over all men's children, including the right to kill them, and should be able to force them to pay support for those children long term. And can't even justify why. He can't even tell us. Give us a single reason why. I I did give you a reason. Okay. What? If you have a child, you should take care of it. The reason because you should. Why? Because you should. Oh, because you should. Because you should. Because you should. Exactly. You should give me $100. Okay. Well, I won't. Yeah. But if you said you but you should Okay. You should Yeah, but you should they should raise their children. Yeah, but but why they should fight for their child? Why? Because it's their child. Why? There doesn't need anymore. That's a sentence. You're just saying, dude, that doesn't that doesn't say anything. Yeah. Okay. It doesn't say anything. It says nothing. Father should just not take care of the children. No, but here's the thing that's interesting, right? It's like you're doing everything to enable women to kill men's children. I don't agree with that framing, but go for it. Well, I mean, here's the thing, right? Can men say anything about it? Nope. Well, then there's nothing. There's no framing here to disagree with. Yeah, it's not killing. Quick uh clarifying question for you just uh because it's come up a couple times. Do you want to just state your quick position on abortion? Are you pro pro-choice? I'm not I'm here to talk about I'm pro choice, but I'm not here to talk about abortion. We don't have to get into abortion, but that's what always happens on this show. It's like we're here to talk about red pill manosphere and we're talking about abortion. It's just really fascinating. Well, there's a bunch of different pro Yeah. When you ask when you ask a bunch of different questions and I test your logic and it moves into that, what's unfair about that? Well, it's because you lose the point of what we're here to talk about. I'm not losing any points. Yeah, you are. You lose the point of what we're talking about. This is what this this is why your debates take five hours is because you get into all these stupid little side arguments that don't go into what we talked about in our opening statement. Let's do it this way. You ask a question, I ask a question. You answer, I answer. How's that? And then we can't deter it. You want to do it that way? I I'm I'm following Brian's moderation. I'm fine with that if you guys want to go back and forth. You think I'm trying to be evasive with you? No, it's not evasive. It's just that every time. Or maybe you just want a filibuster. I have nothing about filibustering. I'm You're doing most of the talking, bro. It's been pretty equal. I think it's been Yeah, you guys have both talked a good amount. Okay. All right. Here we got more chats, though, then we'll get into some of the debate stuff. We have Christopher. Thank you, Christopher. Appreciate it. Christopher Scott donated $100. Thanks, man. Just because men don't file for custody doesn't mean they abandon their children. There could be an agreement outside of court for shared custody. That's fair, but statistically more men abandon the children than women. Okay. Uh we have Jason Cassell. Thank you guys. By the way, if you want to get one in uh streamlabs.com/ whatever we're doing $100. The the thing is so funny about that is like but you advocate for a society where the women own the children. So it's advocate for a society where women get to make the decision whether or not they have a child. So they own the child. No, they they own their pregnancy. Yeah. So they so so they own the right over the life of the man's child literally by the they own a pregnancy and the father should take care of it after that. But what if the man so but if the woman doesn't want to take care of it, she gets out. If the father doesn't want to take care of it, he does not. Right. Correct. So then the ownership of the child and life and death of the child and life and death of the father falls to the woman. Okay. Life's not fair, Andrew. So So don't you think women have a greater responsibility here for reproduction than men? I think women have a responsibility for their pregnancy and then a father and a mother Hold on. I'm talking and then the father and the mother have a responsibility to raise a child. Okay, that's not my question. Repeat my question. Repeat my question. Yeah, but that's my stance. Okay, so I'm going to ask the question again, then actually answer my question. Don't you think that if it is the case that you advocate that only women can have the right to terminate a pregnancy and that only women can have the right to bring it to bear and that affects the man's life and it affects the child's life. But the sole decision is on her for reproduction. Why doesn't she have a greater responsibility to who she [ __ ] reproduces with? Why? Because the other person was involved just as much. I don't know what to [ __ ] do with [ __ ] so stupid. Yeah, it's stupid. So way more. So so she has way more privilege, right? Way more privilege privilege. Yeah. Way more privilege. But for some odd reason, no greater. No more. No. No. Not even equal responsibility. Like this [ __ ] wild to me. Yeah. So let me just make sure. Well, can you say it for me one more time? Say it for me one more time. that women, right, even though they get to determine the pregnancy the entire time, have no greater duty or responsibility for who they reproduce with. Correct. Even though they're the gatekeepers of reproduction because someone else was a part of that birth. Even though they're the gatekeepers of reproduction. Gatekeeper. Okay. Well, they're the literally someone entered the gate, Andrew. Don't they have a responsibility? No, they could just kill whoever came through. Whatever the result of that, but someone walked through the [ __ ] gate, right? Yeah. How could I don't know how you can possibly uh make this claim consistent for me. How do they not have a greater duty when they are the ones who can reproduce? Men can't reproduce and they don't have the option of saying no afterwards. Only women have the greater duty of the pregnancy and then after that the mother and the father should raise the child together. That's my stance. Okay. Well, let me ask you this. No, we're moving on. Do you think that in dating Oh, no. You Yeah. Go ahead. Do you think do you think in dating, right, that it would be like a really big deterrent if I knew that if I had sex with a woman, even if I cared about her, right, and she got pregnant, that I would have zero choice over the the health and welfare of my child, but she would have 100% of the choice over that. Isn't that how it is today? Yeah. So, what's the difference? Yeah. So, so right now today, don't you think that that would act as a massive deterrent in dating, which is the thing you want men and women to do again? What's what's changed about that? When's when when hasn't that been the case? When's the last time that wasn't the case? What? That women had the scenario? Yeah. So, before the 60s. Okay. Well, people were still dating, right? Yeah. But do don't you think that abortion had an arc where previous generations were not as accustomed to it as they are now? And before there wasn't that many people resisting it. And now many, many more. We have the it's the age of the internet, right? So you don't think men are dating because they're afraid women are going to abort their child? I would say do do you think do you think any reason is a monolithic one? Not necessarily. No. Yeah. So So I could have many reasons, right? Yeah. But you're asking about this one in particular. Yes. That's right. This one in particular. Do you think that that would cause incentive, more incentive at least for men to be very wary of the dating market if it is the case that women can have the choice over the reproduction of their child? No, I don't. Why? Because it hasn't really changed that much since the 60s. So, I don't I I I really don't understand this. It even if it is a case that boomers, right, who didn't really have to deal with this problem as much as it's it's done. I mean, it's casual now. It's casual. Like, do you think in the 60s and 70s that women were female comedians were televising their abortion like Sarah Silverman? No. But you said it's more casual, right? Yeah. that their abort their their abortions are more casual and and sex is more casual too. Yes. So that doesn't seem like much of a deterrent. What do you mean? Guys are still banging. Sex, correct? The sex isn't a deterrent. The sex is regardless of relationships. If the sex is what causes the child, Andrew, the sex is what causes the child. So if more casual sex is happening, then it's not much of a deter. If you're dating a woman, is that casual sex? No, we're talking about sexual dating. Say the word. It's obviously not. If people are having casual sex, I don't need to say your [ __ ] If people are having more casual sex, then they're obviously not that deterred by the idea of this woman could terminate the pregnancy. So, I'm talking about dating. I asked you about that word dating. You say casual sex, but then casual sex, not dating. So, that you shouldn't logically put that in. Makes no sense. So, we're talking about dating. Do you think if you're dating a woman, right, that you would be deterred from dating the thing you want to do by the fact that she has complete and total control over reproduction? No, because I don't think men are avoiding dating because they're like, "Oh man, she might abort my child." But really, but I thought you just said that there was an uptick in casual sex. There is. Instead of dating, not instead of dating. I'm saying there's been casual sex for a long time. Is dating up or down? Dating is down. Is casual sex up or down? It's about the same as it was probably whenever we were in college. No. Okay. No. Do you think that casual But even if that was the case, dating is down. Casual sex the same. So that mean would it still mean that people are having more casual sex than they're dating? Right. Yeah. But I don't think they're not dating because they're afraid they're going to have a child. You don't even think it could be possibly a contributing factor. You wouldn't even grant a contributing factor? No. Okay. What about for the religious? Is it contributing factor for them? I think they're probably not having premarital sex to begin with. Oh, dude. Just because you're religious, right, you could you can still give into temptation, right? Okay. Don't you think that would be a deterrent? I think they're more abstinent than a lot of secular people. Sure. But wouldn't it be a deterrent? No. No. So, because I don't think a religious person would get an abortion. What the hell are you talking about? What? Because you're religious. The person you're dating has to be. I I would imagine if you're dating a religious person, you're probably religious, too. No, that's not the case. Especially not for Christian men. They date secular women constantly. Okay? And it's a it's a fear they talk about often that, hey, if I slip up and she gets pregnant, she can actually just take out my kid. There's nothing I can do about it. But I want to get which is why they they date less and less secular women trying to move more and more towards Christian women. Doesn't that lower the chance of dating? No, that doesn't. Okay. I I know you want to ask a question. We'll finish up the chats and you can uh ask the question. Here we have Jason Cassell. Oh, really quick, Kaibaka. I don't know if you're still watching on Twitch. It won't let me trigger the gifted subs. I think you sent in 40 uh gifted subs on Twitch. Thank you so much, Kibbaka. Appreciate it. We have Jason here. Thank you, man. Appreciate it. Jason Castle donated $100 to the feminist man. You may be one of the dumbest individuals to debate, Andrew. You don't know what an is. You don't know what descriptors are. And you said f the logic. You are beyond dumb. You did say [ __ ] the logic. I did. I absolutely did. Why would you say [ __ ] the logic? Because that's not what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to talk about that red pill people are not dating and I don't think it's helping them. That's what I'm here to talk about. Okay. Well, here let's let's get through the chats just cuz we have a smoke. Okay. Uh and let's see. We have Jason Cassell again here. Jason Castle donated $100. Andrew will be back. The dumb feminist man. The reason the feminism movement has gained the power it has is because of weak, dumb men like you. Way to go, dummy. You want to respond to Jason? Um, I'm glad that the feminist movement has gained as much traction as it has. All right. Thank you, Jason. Appreciate that. We have uh Chef Dill Pickles coming in here. Uh, thank you for that, Chef Dill Pickles. Appreciate it. Chef Dill Pickles donated $99. feminist, would you say it's about 13% of the fathers leaving?

I appreciate the half compliment. I mean, I'm not a debater, but I literally am here to try to help people get out of depression and get out of the red pill space. That's what I'm trying to do.

Sorry to hear about uh your situation and he included the uh case number two. Uh Lulu here. Thank you. Appreciate it. Lulu donated $100. Can this guy debate in good faith instead of resorting to this just my stance? The end. You came on this podcast to debate. So do it. When you can't defend, when your ideas are challenged, why are you here? You want Okay. Yeah. Um, so no, I came here with an agenda for sure. I'm not the best debater. This is only my second debate ever. Um, so yeah, maybe I'm I I messed up on some logic, but I am here with an agenda to try to help people get out of the red pill. That's all I'm doing. All right, we have Christopher Scott here. Christopher Scott donated $100. This dude is such a petulent child. No, I'm not going to answer. Butterfly logic. Quit whining, kitten. You want to Oh, it transl It was It It said It said [ __ ] but it it automatically changes it. I don't know why. Christopher, do you want to respond to Christopher? Uh, nah, you're good. Okay. Uh, can you pop the doors open? And there's a I know you said you were hot. There's an ice pack there for you if you need it or not. No, I'm good. Okay, Mary, just grab that ice pack uh once you get a moment. All right. And then we have some super chats we need to get to, guys. It could It could be I'm red. I have the Asian flush from the whiskey. I think the whiskey might have heated you up. I got the Asian flush. Did Did I get the Asian flush? Well, you're uh Irish, right? Mhm. They're They're kind of Asian. Yeah. Well, they call it the Asian flush. Okay. Yeah. No, I've heard of that. Mhm. All right. We have emotional damage. I once knew a guy who talked uh Mary the just on the corner of the table here. Can I read this? Yeah, go for it. I once knew a guy talk like this dummy. He's now divorced and happily broke while his wife is living in his house and driving his car. He still feels content in his life because he gets to pay her. Can you take that one? Because he gets to pay her half of his salary. Lost custody of his kid. Such a proud feminist. Emotional damage. Good to see you in the chat. Thank you. Sad for that guy, but I'm happily married and I don't see that as my outcome. How long you've been married for? Uh coming up on 3 years together about eight or nine. Congratulations. Thank you. There you go. And may you have many children that your wife can determine whether she wants she wants to abort. We don't want children, but we're not worried about that. That's not Why am I not shock? Are you an anti-natalist? No. No. Okay. All right. We have Lucas here. Uh it looks like there's a string of them. One, what the concept of submission outlined in Ephesians 5:22, wives, submit yourselves to your own husband as you do to the Lord is not pertinent to interexual dynamics. Oh, but wait, only in your small circle, Andrew, that small circle representing 62% of the population of the US population, this guy is a woke clown. But let me guess, Camala voter. Yes. Or did you vote? Definitely. Definitely voted Camala 100%. Sorry, champ. My wife and I vote MAGA unapologetically. Good-looking wife, by the way. Lucas, Lucas is uh, you know, he's he's going to have some good-looking kids. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See, he's married. He watches the They watch the podcast together. That's good. Do Would you say most of your audience is married? Most of mine is. Would you say I know I heard you say that? Would you say that she is a misogynist? I won't. I don't know anything about her. Is Lucas Let me caveat it. It may not be. Most of them are married, but most of them are in marriageable age and a significant portion is married. Okay. Well, let me ask you this. Do you think of the content creators that we're talking about, including the audience here, would you say most of them are married, in a relationship, or would you say the majority aren't of the viewers? Yeah, I haven't pulled them. I wouldn't know. Do you have like I'll go ahead and grant probably the majority of them probably aren't married. Why would that matter? I'm just or in a relationship. I don't know. I haven't pulled my audience. I mean, we're kind of about to reach a threshold soon where most of the population is not going to be married or in a relationship. But the whole point that I'm trying to make is that I think Red Pill content is furthering that divide because it makes people not want to date. Actually, I wanted to let me just finish the chat. But just if you want just write a note and we'll we'll get it in. Oh, wait. I need to finish Lucas's. Hold on. Ogle. I'll come back to that one in just a moment. Let me finish up Lucas's. Uh, so sir Simple, can you square this circle for me? I'm a happily married redpilled Christian nationalist MAGA voter. So based based uh so is my wife. So is my wife by the way on each of the preceding fronts. And yet according to you he's a I'm a radicalized miserable incel loner misogynist. Do you want to respond to that? I would love to. The studies show that most people who consume red pill content are becoming isolated, angry, mad at women and they're dating less. You are an exception. Could you say the same about like feminism though? Which of the studies show that? By the way, all the ones I gave you. The case of misuse of evolutionary psychology and online manosphere communities. Yep. The case for female uh all of them. All three things I just cited different studies. Yeah. Can you tell me though? You didn't you didn't put in who the people were for the studies because often times you can click I'll send you the electronic file if you want. Have you heard Have you heard of what's called publishing bias? Sure. Let's not trust stats. No, no, no. It's not it's not about that. Listen, like, hear me out here, okay? Um, there's something called a the replication crisis. You ever heard of that? The replication crisis? No. When you go back to redo sociology studies, the vast majority of them can't be replicated. Okay. The vast majority. And that would be psychology and sociology. Would you say that these studies that you gave me are mostly sociological? Yes. Okay. And would therefore suffer from the replication crisis and that would mean that there's a good possibility that up to 60% of what you just gave me here will never be replicated. I think when you have so many studies saying similar things, I don't think that's an issue. I also think that you can grant that most of the red pill community are potential like incelss is a there's a ven diagram of people in the red pill. But that's where publishing bias comes in. Hold on. Mhm. In the red pill community, incelss are a big part of the red pill community. What is What is an incel? Someone who's involuntarily celibate, meaning they can't have sex, even though they'd like to. Okay. So, they can't get a hooker. I I guess. But maybe they don't want to. Maybe they want a real They're not involuntarily celebrated. Do you not believe in incels? So, they're not involuntarily. Well, I just I'm asking you a question. Why are you ask You're asking me a stupid question. Do you not believe in incels? Can Can an incel buy a hooker? Sure. Okay. Then you say they don't want to potentially. So, how are they involuntarily celibate? You think they should buy a hooker? No, I'm asking how they're involuntarily celibate because they can't get someone to date them, Andrew. But that wouldn't be I'm sorry. What does celibacy mean? This is the same [ __ ] you do. What are we talking about? If you don't acknowledge that incelss are real, just say that, but don't try to play this game. Don't play debate club with me. Don't play debate club with me. Debate clubbing nothing. I'm making debate club. No, it's not. See, semantics are a big debate club thing. Semantics are part of debate. Do you believe that incelss are real? Do it's hard to say. Depends on what you can't just say yes. It depends on what you can't just say yes because this is what you do. I will say yes or no if you just clarify for me that an involuntary celibate is a person who just can never get sex no matter what. That's typically the definition. Yes. Okay. Can these people get prostitutes? Can they buy prostitutes? Who knows? You don't you don't know if they can. I maybe they don't have money. I have no idea. Oh, okay. Do incels exist? By that definition, not my definition. Do incelss exist? Well, it depends. Well, depends. Do incels exist? From my definition, this is some [ __ ] game. My definition or yours? Anyone's definition? Just Bro, I don't know why you don't understand what semantics are. I don't understand why you can't answer the question. I don't need to be walked through it. I don't want to play your game, dude. I'm not playing a game. Yes, you are. Do incels exist? Oh, not by your definition. I have no idea if incelss exist. How could I even admit to Oh my god. Okay, let me ask you a question. Do lifippados exist? Not that I know of. Wait, wait. What's a leaf flipadoo? Who knows? Then how the [ __ ] do you know if they exist or not? Have you read a study on inflipados? Well, why would that matter? Okay, I did. Do leaf flipados exist or not? Okay, Andrew, and what I mean by leaf flipadoo what I mean by leaf flipadoo is you have a proprietary definition. Okay, you can't. So this this is what's called equivocation. It's facious argumentation. It's called debate club. That's what you're doing. It's called debate club. Are you in a debate? I didn't think so. I think we're having a discussion. No. Why? Because we're having a discussion about red pill. You sat down before the show, didn't she? An excellent. We're having a discussion about red pill. But now you're saying that red pill communities don't have incels, which is complete [ __ ] Well, they don't exist in your world. Not what I said either. You're trying to get some stupid definition that doesn't exist. Listen, I'm trying to explain this to you. No, you're not trying to do [ __ ] Avoid the question. When you're done, I'll explain. You're not trying. No, I don't need to be explaining. Well, I'm going to explain it anyway. So just so that you understand definitionally things can be here's debate club 101 everybody if you want to be in the debate club listen everybody because this is super important right super important incelss don't exist in a debate incels don't exist by the way we're in a debate all you incelss out there it's not true all you incelss I'm sorry doesn't believe you exist he doesn't think you exist well when when you're done I'll explain I'm not I'm done but I'm not going to so I'll explain so if if you're an incel in No if you're an incel doesn't think you exist he thinks you should just go buy a hooker. Just FYI, which would definitely Which Wait, Andrew, just go ahead. Which if he could buy a hooker, by his definition would make you an incel. So, how this works is if somebody has a definition of something is proprietary, right? I don't know what he means by the thing he's asking. So, I asked him, does that just mean you can't get sex under any circumstances? Yes. Okay. Can they buy a hooker? Yes. Well, then they can't they can get sex under some circumstances. So, don't stop. Stop, bro. So, by your logic, they wouldn't be incelss. Now, if you have a different definition than that and you want to give it to me, I'm willing to engage with it in good faith. You're not arguing in good faith. This is a complete and utter bad. You're not You're not making an argument at all. I'm saying incels exist and you're saying, "Well, what do you mean by incel?" Yes, it's important. No, it's not important. It's proprietary. Definition proprietary. No, it's not important. You're making it important. It's not. Okay. The fact that you deny that incels exist is so silly. That's not what I did. Hold on. Okay. So, let me read a couple chats and if you guys want to continue talking about that specific thing, we will. Ogle, thank you for the gifted 50 memberships. Thank you so much, man. Really appreciate it, guys. W's in the chat for Ogle. He just gifted 50 to the uh whatever community. Thank you, man. Appreciate it very much. We have a couple chats here coming through. We have Ogle, speaking of ogle_glue.net donated $100. It wasn't meant to be a dick. I appreciate people who have good intentions and act on them. There's just the road to hell is paved for a reason is all I'm saying. Thanks, Ogle. And honestly, man, I really am here to try to help as many people as I can. That's really all I'm here for. I'm not here to win a debate and, you know, be in debate club. I'm trying to really help incels and people in the red pill community who feel lonely and depressed. But Andrew wants to play definition. Yeah, I know. Terrible. I want you clarify what you mean by things. No, you want to play a definition game. 17 years. Seven lawsuits filed against me. Grandparents filed. Three protection orders. Three false arrests. Untold thousands of dollars. I won, but it almost killed me. I don't blame guys. He sent one in earlier, right? Was this the same guy who included the case number? No, that was rifted. Uh, well, it seems like there's somebody ghost. He had another poor experience. I assume this is related to divorce proceedings, child custody proceedings. Uh Ghost really started to hear that. Same. And honestly, man, I appreciate that you fight for your children. That's all I'm asking for is that men who want to be with their children, they fight for it. I'm sorry it's so hard. That it shouldn't be that hard, but that's all I'm saying should happen should you have a child. It shouldn't be so hard. It shouldn't be. I don't think so. Okay. I You know what? Great. This is a great red pill talking point. Wait, let me let me Okay, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. They also they also don't believe that it should be so hard. And so they're fighting tooth and nail, especially um you know, men's rights advocacy, MAS, men's rights advocacy group, so that it's not so hard. That's one subsect of the red pill community. But again, as we established, the red pill content creators that we're talking about promote uh promise. Well, you only mentioned two. Uh I mentioned three. Who? Andrew Tate, Fresh and Fit. This podcast This podcast does not promote promis. I'm trying to avoid it cuz I like Brian. No, no, no. This podcast does not promote promiscuity. Okay. I would like I need It doesn't promote marriage. Yes, it Well, I You do. But I'm not saying you do. Well, wait a second. I'm sorry. I thought it was was about dating. Your whole TW wasn't enough about dating. Does it need to promote marriage? It doesn't promote marriage. Does it need to? I You don't think people should get married? That's fine. I should Well, should the dating podcast promote marriage? I think so. The date the dating podcast should promote marriage. I think so. Yeah. I think that isn't that the point. But you can't ask questions. You can't ask questions about abortion. Isn't that the point of dating? Why do you date if you're not going to try to get married? Why do you date if you're not going to try to get married? There's a lot of people who want to get who date without getting married. Yeah. Tons. Okay. But should you? I don't think so. Okay. Well, then shut up. But don't you? No. I think I think people should get married if they want to get married. That's what I think. Yeah. So then they should be able to date without getting married? Sure. If they'd like to. So then what are you even bitching about? I'm not bitching. I'm saying that this podcast Fresh and Fit [ __ ] [ __ ] Andrew Tate, Fresh and Fit. And I'm sorry, Brian. Brian doesn't believe in marriage and these people and you're you're promoting. Neither do you. You don't believe it either. Yeah, I don't. I just got married. You literally just said, "I think people should get married if they want to." Okay. Oh, great. So, is that a promotion of marriage? They should get married if they want to. Is that promoting marriage? Is it? Sure, Andrew. And answer my question. Is are you promoting marriage by saying, "Hey everybody, you should get married if you want to." It's not not promoting marriage. Well, this I tell you what, it's a lot less than what I promote. I'm not saying you me a staple of this show. Here, we'll get We got a couple more chats here, guys. Almost done. We got Jason Cassell. Oh, boy. Okay, here he goes. Jason Castle donated $100. I would keep an eye on your wife. Even feminist women really want real men. Unfortunately for you, you are a feminist, so you will probably be okay with it because you don't want to tell her what to do. I'd love Jason to uh define what a real man is. So, if he can send in another $100, a real man is a guy who sends in another $100 or champagne pop. That that's that's an option. You know, maybe a little liquor for Jason. A real man sends in a champagne pop. Little liquor. Maybe uh I don't know if it'll get things a little more aggressive. And then I'll make sure that he doesn't get any. You're You'll drink You'll pound the whole bottle. He'll pound the whole All right, we got Red Fox here. Thank you, man. Thank you, Jason. Good to see you, man. Red Fox donated $100. Thank you, man. If your goal is to convince people away from Red Pill, why don't you just talk to Andrew and thoroughly think through your position. Instead, you divided the audience. You seem like an useful idiot. I would love to talk about just the red pill, but Andrew puts conversations into all kinds of different things. We'll talk about abortion. We're talking about single mothers. We're talking about all this stuff even though I'm trying to pull people out of this. So, I'm I'm trying to give a justification for red pill ideology. And one such justification would be that women have reproductive control which could create incentives for men to not want to be with women in modernity. Now, you literally told me that is in no way, shape, or form cuz I asked you five time wrote it down five times and you said that if that is in no way a contributing factor. Do you think right now anybody should ever take anything you [ __ ] say seriously after you said that? Yes, absolutely. Okay. Because I'm trying to help people get out of this thing. You're just trying to keep people divided. Christopher Scott donated $100. Thank you, Christopher. Appreciate. You're not here in good faith. You won't answer questions. You whine about everything and act like a child. Man up. You want to respond to that or No. Okay. Uh Christopher, thank for the soup chat. We have Lucas here and then we'll get back to the uh debate portion. Lucas, uh, pink hatwear, I have an honest question for you. You say you have a podcast of female guests geared towards helping men. Do you truly believe right of center men align with your positions or is your target audience white dudes for Camala? Genuine question from Lucas there. I appreciate the genuine question. Um, I only started a month ago, but I've gotten over a million views and I've gotten a lot of messages from people who are in red pill and they say, "You're giving me hope that all the stuff that they say out there about a man has to be six foot tall, a man has to make six figures, a man has to have six-pack abs, those are the only guys that women want." And the women I interview are definitely, especially the the married ones are saying that isn't the case. So, a lot of people a lot of people have said, "Thank you so much. I appreciate it." fathers have reached out to me and said, "Hey, I appreciate what you're doing. My sons are going to watch your videos because I really hope they don't go down the red pill rabbit hole." So, it has nothing to do with left. I'm not a political person. I mean, I am personally, but my podcast has nothing to do with politics. It really is let's help these guys see that women aren't the, you know, paras that podcast in the red pill space make them out to be. You're talking about Blackpill descriptors. I'm talking about people who listen to Red Pill content. Yeah, I know. That's not what even even the guys that you stated, Tate, all those guys, they don't say that that's all women want. What they say is that if you want to heighten your chances for dating the type of woman that you want, right, you would work on male self-improvement and here's things that you could do to do that. That is not what they say. They say you should if if women only want high status men, that's what they say. No, they don't say only either. Yes, they do. Okay. So, listen. Do you understand that? Like if you work at a [ __ ] Starbucks as a woman and you're dating a janitor, he's high status to you, right? What? Yeah. Did you hear what I said? If someone's working at Starbucks and they're dating a janitor, that man's high status. Yeah. If he's making $29 an hour as a [ __ ] janitor and you're a barista, he would be high status, right? I I don't know that they'd see it like that, but Okay. Okay. Well, how do they see it? You tell me. They see it as like, I like this guy. I don't want to date him. I think that's what they see. Okay. No. No. How do these Red Pillars see it? They see it as no one who works as a janitor will get a woman. No, they don't see it that way. Yes, they do. No, you're totally You're totally wrong on this. No, I'm not. So have I. Who? Which ones? The people who write me. Are you talking about the content creator? I'm talking about the people who follow this [ __ ] Yeah, I'm talking about the content creators you're talking about. I'm talking about the actual people who listen to it and they write me and they say there's no way a woman would date somebody who works at McDonald's. And that's not true. And they listen, I don't know what these individuals are telling you. Talk to the individual. I'm telling going to tell you what the content creators are saying. Okay. And by the way, I also watch what they say. Okay. Well, here's here's what they say. Here's what Myron Gaines would agree to. And I guarantee you Andrew Tate would agree to it. I guarantee you that that both of those guys would and I know Brian would as well. Okay. They're trying to say that of course men should work on male improvement. That doesn't mean that you're all women on planet Earth are only going to want you if you're in the top 1% or the top 15%. That's [ __ ] absurd. You can watch If that's absurd, then tell me why every red pillar I come across believes that. They don't. They do. They don't. Every red pillar I come across believes that. You know what? Show me a message. I'll show you. Go through my Tik Tok. Just go to my Tik Tok right now. Scroll through my comments. No, no, no. Just show me a single DM. I didn't say DM. I said comments. Oh, in the comments. Yeah. So what? So what? That doesn't count. People Red Pillars can't comment. Red pillars can't Oh, yeah. No, you're not sure. You're not sure they can write the words. The words aren't there. Trying to answer. No, you're not. You're not. I'm not I'm not sure that it's legitimate. No, because that it legitimately comes from Myin Gaines, who would not tell you that a janitor can't date a woman at Starbucks? That's [ __ ] crazy. would never say it in a million years. I know the guy. He would never say that [ __ ] I'm telling you that when I ask women, "Would you date someone under 6' tall?" Every guy in there says, "That's just not true. That's just not true. That's just not true." Because they believe the [ __ ] that they're seeing from this stuff. That's [ __ ] It's not [ __ ] It's true. And this is the point I'm trying to make. Every guy who listens to Red Pill, let me tell you something. The fact that you don't care about these [ __ ] guys is the problem. You don't care about these guys. Andrew, let me tell you something. Do you think there's a problem with man male on the lives in this country? Yes. Okay. Do you what are you doing about it? Well, I mean, the first thing I did was advocate an anti-war position because PTSD is what led to a lot of the unliving stats. That's some of the stats, but there's other people that aren't in the military that question. What was your question? What do you do to help these people? And do you think that advocating for an anti-war stance that doesn't help people? When someone has what happened, let's say there is no more war and people still have PTSD, what do they do? Well, they get treatment. Okay. So, you believe in treatment for PTSD. There's lots of men's groups which are good for treatment. Do you believe in treatment for severe depression in some cases? What cases wouldn't you advocate for it? It depend it would depend on the criteria for severe. What how how what what do you mean I can't get out of [ __ ] bed in the morning and all they think about it is unaliv. Yeah. Like the incels 95% of them report that you may have to have medical. No, they don't. 95% don't report that they can't get out of bed in the morning. 95% report depression. Yeah, of course you do. cuz you don't give a [ __ ] about people. You don't care about people on literally not true. Do you believe in therapy? In some cases, therapy can be helpful and in other cases it [ __ ] people up. Okay. What cases is therapy messing with people? Well, so psych Okay, let's get into it. Psychology is the study of the mind. Can you tell me what is the disease process for you to diagnose a person with a psychological disorder? I don't know, but I do know that because it [ __ ] exists. So what that doesn't mean therapy doesn't work. Okay. How does it work? Have you looked into the studies about CBT? Uh CBT like the marijuana stuff? No, that's CBD. What is CBT? You don't know about cognitive behavioral therapy? No. What is it? Well, then what is it? It's one of the most successful versions of therapy that have helped a lot of people get out of depression. Okay. What does it do? It's a talk therapy that basically shows cognitive study of the mind. It's not a study of the mind. Yes. Well, it has to be because No, it's talk therapy where talk therapy doing what? to help you get elevate your mood and get you out of bed. And could you go with like, I don't know, an instrument and do a little test on a guy and be like, "Oh, your depression level was here and now it's here." Do you know how people answer my question and then ask me a question? Do you know how people typically and then ask No, because that's not how it's tested. Yeah. Right. Exactly. Because it's not how it's [ __ ] because that's not how it's tested. You said answer the question and then I could say. So here I am saying that's not how it's tested. Yeah. Because it's not a disease. Depression is not a disease. No. This is why I know that out there if you're depressed, Andrew doesn't give a [ __ ] about you. It's not a disease. Andrew doesn't give a [ __ ] about you. If you're depressed, it's not a disease. It's just something in your head. I will bet you $100 right now. You can get your cell phone look up if depression is actually a classified disease. For the record, if you have if you have depression, if you have depression, Andrew doesn't care. It's not a disease. Cognitive behavioral therapy doesn't work. Is it a disease? Bet. 100 bucks. Yes. Okay. Then then go grab your phone. No, I'm not grabbing. You're not going to bet? No. Cuz it's not a [ __ ] disease. So people aren't there. If you're going to like talk to the audience this camera, if Andrew if you have severe depression, Andrew doesn't care if you get help. He doesn't He doesn't think you should get help because it's [ __ ] Because depression isn't real. By the way, depression is not a real thing. It's not a disease. It's not a disease. So that means you shouldn't get it treated because it's not considered a disease. So okay. So I don't understand. How do we get from depression's not a disease and that means that depression doesn't exist? You don't believe in the treatments for it. No, no, no. What I was trying to demonstrate to you is that psychology is a study of the mind. And because of this, you can actually do interventional treatments on people which do more damage than good. Because tell me a study that it does more damage than good. Do you know what? So you want psychologists to start studying in their own field where 60 70% plus of the studies can't be replicated and govern their own field by telling you that the studies that they're making are bad. Therapy isn't real to Andrew because you can't replicate it. Therapy is [ __ ] Yeah, psychology is therapy is [ __ ] I asked him if he thinks therapy is realology is [ __ ] I I said I asked him if therapy is real. He said some instances now it's [ __ ] The real truth comes out. There can be there can be therapeutics that work. Yes. But therapy by and large in and of itself as an occupational is [ __ ] and psychology is [ __ ] Yeah, there are several studies that show the improvement. There's several studies that are done by the same people who are studying the mind. If you're depressed, Andrew doesn't care about you. I just want to point that out. I don't understand. Do what? When did I say depression is not real? You don't care about the treatment. Yeah. When did I say that? I didn't care about treatment. You don't because you don't believe it exists. Do you know that you can treat uh depression with things like uh hormone replacement therapy? That's one avenue. Yes. Yeah. I don't understand. Um, if I would recommend that you would you would do things like hormone replacement therapy under the guide of an actual medical doctor, right, who didn't get a [ __ ] arts degree in psychology, by the way, but an actual MD, right, who gives you something like hormone replacement. That stuff is truly effective for treating this type of stuff. There can be hang on there can be limited instance of men's groups which seem to help with PTSD and things like this but by and large psychology is a [ __ ] croc of [ __ ] Go ahead and demonstrate for me why it's effective. Okay. So if you have severe depression maybe get some hormone therapy. That's what Andrew is recommending instead of going to seek out a therapist. Read a book. What's the cure rate for the severely depressed? CBT has significantly improved people with severe depression. CBT has how many? I don't have the study in front of me, but it's significant. How much? It's significant. Just like you said earlier, you said earlier significant. That was that was an acceptable answer before too. Of course you do, cuz you don't think you don't you don't care about people with severe depression. You don't care about people with severe depression. You don't give a [ __ ] You don't care about them. So many people in the red pill community have severe depression and you don't care. So many people in the red pill community have severe depression and you don't give a [ __ ] So I you have to understand how illogical this is. How much it doesn't make sense. Yeah. Because it's all [ __ ] Me saying that you should be guarded in the treatment of psychology means that I don't care about people. I have depression. Can you explain that logic to me? You don't care about the treatment. You don't believe that the treatment is real. And you think the only thing they should do is go to hormone treatment therapy. And also you think that PTSD also you think that people with PTSD it kind of works there. But if you have severe depression as an incel, it won't work there. Yeah. It didn't say that either. That's what you're saying. You know, you're just straw manning me. Sure, I'll straw man till you correct me. Okay. So, anyway, so are there alternative therapies which can you can recommend? You don't even know what CBT is. So, what therapies do you know about? CBT is the most popular, by the way. Okay. Yes. So, what? So, you don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking about? Okay. So, help me out here. What is psychology? It's a study. It's a study. Yeah, it's a study. Okay. Help me out here. Why is therapy [ __ ] I didn't say therapy is [ __ ] Okay. What I was talking about was psychology being [ __ ] There can be therapeutics, I said, which work a thousand times I've said this. There can be therapeutics which work. Which ones? But if you're talking about therapists, which ones? Well, for especially for people, so the ones that I'm familiar with are people have PTSD and there seem to be therapeutics which work inside of these like uh groups who've gone through very similar experience and them being able to discuss and uh form communities around these types of things. But I but I'm not sure that it's because of the discussions as much as it is about the community they're forming. So, what is your solution for the vast number of people who consume this content that are reporting severe depression? Um, well, I I don't I first of all, you haven't demonstrated that's the case. You just say here's some studies, but No, that's not enough. Well, you I'd have to read the studies. Are men unaliviving themselves at an alarming rate? Um, what is that? Cheers. Oh, thanks. Yeah, that's you. And that's a concern for you or no? Yeah, it's a big concern. But you don't believe therapy? Uh, well, no. I didn't say again for the hundth time. Some therapeutics can work for some men who are in severe depression. But you know what causes a lot of this. What I asked you this question earlier and I've just in a good faith way answered a ton of yours. Can you answer this one for me now? What's that? Men who get divorced, what happens to their unaliving rate? Yeah. a lot of men who get divorced and I you know it I get it and I feel for those men and I hope that they get the help they need but you don't care if they get help they need but why would they need to get help if they didn't get married didn't get divorced well people get divorced that happens yeah I but not if they don't get married then they don't get divorced okay great now it don't when they get divorced the primary reasons that they report this depression is that they lost custody of their kids right sure yeah but I thought that women having control over men's kids didn't have anything to do with why men didn't want to get into the dating market. That's not the reason people aren't dating. No. No. You don't think that a big contributor? That's not the reason people aren't dating. So, the reason you think that people aren't dating and marrying is because they men are terrified that women will divorce them and take their kids. No, I don't think that's the reason they're not dating. You don't think so? No. And you don't think that's why they're not getting married? No. Oh, okay. Because college educated people are still getting married. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. Is it that most men? It's a good percentage, but it's not. Okay. It's a good percentage of women. Yes. But they're getting married to somebody. I Yeah, but women are marrying somebody, aren't they? I men. But women are marrying somebody, aren't they? Just cuz you're a woman in college doesn't mean you marry a college educated man. Okay. But that's still people who are college educated are still getting married more, including women. Nobody said include. So, if women are marrying somebody, you disputed this. If women are marrying somebody, they're marrying men. Your concern I thought you were a big marriage advocate, right? Yeah. Mhm. Don't you want marriage advocated for? I want people who really want to get married and find love to do it. Yes. So when So you think that these men who ordinarily would be playing into the dating market trying to find a wife are not concerned whatsoever that she's going to divorce him and take his kids. I don't think that is the main reason people are aren't dating. No. Okay. Then what's the main reason? I didn't say dating. I said marriage. You have to get date to get married, Andrew. Yeah. No, I'm asking about marriage specifically. You have to date to get married. Isn't that a big deterrent? You have to date. Do you have to date to get married? What does that have to do with my question? The question is you said, "Why aren't people getting married?" It's like, well, I'm talking about they're not dating. It's juice. It's It's strawberry lemonade. [ __ ] garbage. Strawberry lemonade. So, anyway, back to this. I'm asking about marriage, not about dating now. Okay. Marriage. Why do you think men do you think that a lot of men don't want to get married? because they're afraid that there could be a divorce and their children taking from them in the future if they get married. No, because I think if they're dating I think if these people are dating, they're likely to eventually get married should the relationship progress. I don't think they're just staying cohabitating the way you you're suggesting. What do you want, dude? I don't know what you want. Put the the waters in frame. Okay, here you go. Is that part of the thing? It's just, you know. All right. Yeah, go ahead. It's his OCD. It's my OCD. Sorry. Go ahead. So, anyway, back to this. What I'm saying is that I think that if people are dating, the eventuality, should the relationship go well, will be marriage. People aren't dating. That's the whole point. So So, okay. So, I don't think if you're dating, you're not going to say, you know what, I can't marry you because I'm afraid you're going to take my kids. That's why I don't think that's happening. So, you think that they would rather stay cohabitating? No. No. I I think if you're dating somebody long term, you're probably going to end up getting married. But you're going to cohabitate first usually, right? Sure. Yeah. And what is the number one indicator of unaliving in men? Cohabitation. That's the reason people are are it's it's you unal alive way more than if you're married, right? If you're cohabitating, unal alive significantly more than when you're not. So what's your point? My point is is that your prescription, which is more dating, more dating, more dating. And then I ask you, does that lead to more cohabitation? You say yes. It would actually be your prescription that led to more men unliving. So men dating is the reason people are unating. No, it's men cohabitating which is dating too. That no you just said that that would be the big side effect which you're fine with. Okay. So in order for men So my prescription would lead to less unaliving of your prescription more. What is your prescription? So I think if men are dating that they should not cohabitate and that's what red pillars think too cuz they actually care about men unaliv. Red pills are going their own. Do you know about men going their own way? MGTTOW is different. They're also red pill. By the way, MGTTOW 100% doesn't want cohabitation. I'm not saying they do. They're going their own way. That's another part of the red pill community. So, they're pushing do not date. Well, if it's the case that you think dating leads to cohabitation before marriage and their prescription doesn't lead to that, then they're saving a lot more [ __ ] lives than you. Good one, Andrew. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Me advocating for people to date is is going to make people unalign themselves. No. Oh, if you think that dating leads to cohabitation and you're fine with cohabitation. I also don't grant that that's the reason most people aren't enving themselves. So, I'd like to see a study on that. Yeah. Well, actually, I can send those to you. Please do. Yeah. What's your number? I'm not going to say it on air. Look in the camera. No, go ahead. Here, let's uh do a little prompt change here. Um, and we'll maybe try to move through these a bit quicker. Uh, so Raphael, you said that the manosphere exploits male pain and by extension, I suppose you would say Andrew exploits male pain, but offers no real healing. Um, can you just specify uh how I guess? Yeah. So, um, a lot of Andrew's rhetoric and and content that he pushes is basically again demonizing women, demonizing feminism, which makes a lot of the men less willing to date women. And that's why a lot of people in the red pill community are not dating women because they act actively see them as adversaries. They actively see them as the enemy. And I think a lot of red pill community uh pushes that that message. Just just one clarifying question. Even if that is what he was doing, can you just um just for the prompt, can you just explain how he's exploiting male pain? Yeah. So I think the more riled up and anger angry that the audiences are, the more money people make. That's what I that's how I think that's the exploitation. I make the most amount of money during chill streams. Okay. But it's normally angry men and that follow these podcasts. Well, I thought you just said the angrier they are, the more money I make. Right. Okay. What? Because keeping them angry, they're going to stay around longer. Okay. So, um let's uh do you think do you think that uh like Joe Rogan for instance that he makes all of his money off of angry men? Not necessarily, but I'm not here to I'm not talking about Joe. Well, I'm just I thought you just said that you make more money if the audience is angry. The red pill community. Oh, it's specific to the red pill. Okay. So, just to make sure that I got this right. Um, I'm doing this. I think you are. I think fresh and let's start with me because I'm here. Okay. So, what am I doing that's riing up men and making them upset? You continue to demonize women and that gets your audience. Do I demonize women or do I demonize feminists? Both. Okay. How do I demonize women? You say some pretty nasty things about them and I've watched a lot of your podcast and if you're going to deny it that's fine but yeah about Okay. So I'm not going to deny that I crack jokes sometimes at the expense of women joke at the expense of women. That's true right but no I I I really don't demonize women as a group. Do you call women a lot of names on your podcast? Uh I call usually a woman. No. Do you call groups of women names? Some like feminists. Yes. No. That's not a name. That's not a derogatory name. At least it is to me. Well, of course it is cuz you hate feminism and you continue to demonize it and you continue to demonize women and you continue to demonize women on your podcast just like Fresh and Fit just like Andrew. Do you think if men agree with me about the ideas that I have, right, that they want to date feminists? I don't think they want to date women. Yeah, they definitely want to date women. They're not. And they're married. A lot of them are married. Maybe on your individual channel, but not on this podcast. How am I riing up [ __ ] a bunch of men to knock? Because you also come here. You also come here and this is a bigger audience than your channel. Yeah. And they guess where they move to my channel. Yeah. The angry men continue to move over to your channel. Oh, okay. Where all the married men are. Not all the married men. Yeah, that's where Listen, show me the breakdown of people. Show me the breakdown of people in your podcast that are married. I bet you right now you're about to see a massive sound off of fever. See it. All married people. Switch over to the live chat. Watch this. Yeah. put it up. We could do a poll. Um, let's see if there's a Now, this is be This would be the whatever sample though, but we could do it on the Crucible and I guarant [ __ ] tear you. I also don't necessarily think that your your poll is going to be accurate, but go for it. Well, I agree. I like literally I do agree with that. But the thing is is like YouTube has much better breakdowns. Yeah. So, yeah, if you would ask me, I would have actually sent that before the debate. But that's what I'm saying. I think Fresh and Fit has that breakdown. I think this podcast has that breakdown. I think Andrew Tate has that breakdown. And I can tell you they're probably not married people. Yeah, I demonize mostly feminists. You demonize women, too. You call women all kinds of names. I've heard it myself, especially on solo podcast. Why is it though that I have so many female followers? You have so many. I actually do. Yeah. What's the percentage? About 10% for my channel. Whoa. Do you do you know that YouTube is is male dominant? Red Pill is male dominated. No, no, no, no. YouTube So, Tik Tok is female dominant. Okay. It's like um I think 70% women. Okay. Right. YouTube male dominant. Okay. Having a channel, right? Like most women's audience is men on YouTube. Okay. The the fact that I have so many female followers is actually not common for a male podcaster. It's actually not common. Well, good for you. But I'm saying that most of the red pill community is not that way. Okay. But you were Who are we talking about? I'm talking about the red pill community. Yeah. What am I doing though to exacerbate this problem of men hating women? I I've already explained that. Yeah. Not really. just say sometimes I I crack jokes about them. I didn't say anything about jokes. You said jokes. I said you demonize women. Okay. Well, here's the thing, too. I crack jokes about Mexicans. Yeah. Am I demonizing? Your audience could be pretty racist, too. I encountered them firsthand in our first debate. Am I demonizing them? Mexicans? Um, well, if you're if you're riing up hate for Mexicans in your chat, then yes, cuz I got a lot of Mexicans in my chat. Okay, good. But if I'm making Mexican jokes, I'm saying jokes. You keep saying jokes. No one else is saying jokes. They're literally jokes. They're literally jokes. Show me. Tell me anything I've said about women. Think of a name. Think of a name you've possibly have called women. Think of any name you've possibly have called a large group of women. Just think about it. A large group or all women. Is there a comma after large? Like are you are you saying I'm saying like women? No. What what's the word? I'm saying women as a whole as as a generalization. What? I'm I'm asking if you've done it. I I mean, nothing comes to mind. Okay. Well, I don't Well, I've said what? I just don't think this is in good faith. Well, what why don't you say what you think? Yeah. What What did I say? I mean, you call them [ __ ] You call them No. Oh, yes you do. No. Oh, yes you do. No, no, no. In fact, [ __ ] is not a word I say often. I'll call individual women skanks. Okay. I don't actually say [ __ ] Oh, skanks. That's such a funny joke. Yeah. And No, no, no. That's not a joke to call an individual woman a skank. You don't do it individually. I do when I say skates. I guess I do your show. Then give me one time. Did Okay. What? I said you call them [ __ ] I don't. Okay. I So I say all women are [ __ ] You've said it before. It's never happened. I didn't say all women. I'm saying [ __ ] You just say [ __ ] Saying the words are [ __ ] So if there's two women and they both [ __ ] 100 dudes, I can't say they're [ __ ] Sure. Sure. How is that demonizing women? Is it saying nice things about women? No, it's saying mean things about those two people. It's not talking about two people, Andrew. You generalize. You generalize about women so much. And the fact that you won't even admit about Bro, you're generalizing. And so do Why are you calling men incels? I have studies that back up that they're incels. Oh, you have So So do I need a study to back up that a chick who's banged 100 dudes a [ __ ] No, you're talking about one person, but you're talking about generalizing all women. That's something you do constantly. That's something that Fresh and Fit does. They generalize women. I'm [ __ ] right here. Tell me what I've said about all women. The point is I'm talking about the red pill community. I'm talking about the red pill community. I'm talking about and I did and I've already said what you've done, but you're denying it for some reason. When I've ever said all women, do you want to go through all your damn podcasts, man? You think if I did it, you'd have an example since it was pertinent. I've seen you do it. So, yes. When? I don't know. Two weeks ago. Andrew, what the [ __ ] I've watched a lot of your [ __ ] Mhm. I've seen so I I've so much I'll tell you what, this is fair. What type of content do I do? Mostly political. Mostly political. Yeah. Okay. And what is the number one type of show that I do? Um, you do debates, but you all I say the topic you debate the most, if it's not Christianity, it's feminism. So, you think the most popular content on my channel is debates? I think so. Okay. followed by political commentary. Sometimes you have political debates as well. We had a political debate. Yeah, I know. But you just said political. Most of my channel is political commentary. I think you consider yourself a political commentator. That's what you say every time you introduce yourself. Well, I No, that's not what I say. I say I'm a political commentator and what? I don't know what the and is. I political satist. Sure. Politics, as I said. Political satist. Okay. So, am I wrong about being polit am I wrong about you being more political focused? Is that Are you Are you making a different point or No. No. What I'm saying to you is I don't actually think that you've watched my show. I have. I've also been on, then what is the thing my show is the most famous for? The one show that we do that is the most famous thing we do. Isn't it debating? Nope. Not even in the same universe. Then what is it? It's the Tik Tok invasions. That's YouTube. Yeah. That's what made us popular. But that's maybe that made you popular at one point, but that's not what you're doing consistently. Every week you're mostly doing debates. Every week. Listen, I do I actually many weeks do less debates than I do invasions. Okay, my point still stands. And by the way, political community do you deny that the red pill community is demonizes women? Yeah, but I want No. No. Ask question. I will. I will. No. No. Answer it now. No. No. No more caveats. No. Does the red pill community demonize women? Yeah. Yeah. No, but I want this. No, it doesn't. No. Okay. No, I don't think so. So, I I want to finish this real quick. Um, have you actually watched my show? Yes. When when's the last time you watched it? I don't know, but this week I obviously saw what you said to Pearl. Obviously saw what you said to that guy on the iPad. Yeah. Well, you couldn't have seen that on my channel. You saw you de you. So, you saw it in her channel, right? So, did you demonize red pill communities this week on your channel or not? Uh, I I might No, I don't think so. When you call them degenerates, I don't think I called red pillars degenerates. You literally said red pill content creators are degenerates, including Myron Gains. You even said you had disagreements with Brian. You even mentioned Brian by name in that same statement. Do you remember when I said that there's a difference between the red pill and what? No, I don't. Content creators. You mentioned Myin and Brian by name. Yeah. So, I'm talking about content creators. Those are content creators. That's not the red pill. The red pill is a disen content creators are degenerates. You're not talking about the packet being a degenerate. You're talking about the creators, right? So, the creators are degenerates. So, you mentioned Myron Gaines and you mentioned Brian by name. I didn't. Yeah. So, here's the thing again. If you're talking about Red Pill content creators, there's a lot more of them than [ __ ] Brian. But we're talking about the big ones. I don't care about the other ones. We're talking about the big ones. The ones that have the most We're talking about the ones that have the most reach, and that's these people. They have the most reach. Okay. What matters is who's informing their opinions? The content creators. No. No. Who's informing the content creators opinions? I don't care. The content creator matters. No, they're disseminating the message. That's what matters. What matters? They're disseminating the message. you're not getting it doesn't they're disseminating a message. I don't care if you learned about Nazism through something else. If you're disseminating it, you're still disseminating is that if there's hundreds hundreds and hundreds of Red Pill content creators, which there are, all you're doing is pointing to three creators you don't like, the biggest ones. No. First of all, the combination of all other Red Pill creators would be bigger than these three biggest ones. Okay. Sure. But they're the biggest ones. No, they're not the combination of the message that you're talking about. Then why did you highlight those two? It's not the biggest. Then why did you highlight my games? you did on your own show. We can pull it up right now. I'm not talking about I'm not talking about Pearl. I'm talking about when you were talking to that guy on the iPad. You said your sound's low. If you don't remember, it's cuz your lack of sleep, but you were talking to a guy. I think it was on Tuesday on your own show. You said red pill content creators are degenerates. I don't I don't know what the context is. You It's literally that there is no context. Of course you're trying to weasel out of this. Of course you're trying to weasel out of it. [ __ ] what I know. Do you want to pull it up? Actually, I do. Okay, let's go to his channel. What show is it? whatever you were talking to that guy on the iPad, whoever that homie was that you were talking to. I don't know who he was. I don't I've never seen him before, but you were on the show. I think it was Tuesday and you said this exact thing. I would love this. Yes, it was on the Crucible. I would love to show this. I would I would love to have this pulled up. Show it. Can we pull it up? Is it behind your payw wall? I don't I don't think so. I saw it and Well, if somebody in the audience can send us the clip of it, you want me to do it? Yeah. Uh, sure. While we're doing that, Mary, can you pull up? We did the poll. We had We had 2,200 people answer the poll. Uh, are you married is the question. 38% 38% say yes. 62% say no, just cuz you guys were curious if the audience was married. That's actually more honest than I thought it would be. 38%. All right. Here, I'll read some chats while you're looking at that. We have, and guys, if you want to get a chat in $100 for a TTS, if you want to get a little message in here while we're getting that pulled up, we have Lucas. Oh, wait. It's two Lucas donated $100. What was your first one, Lucas? Two/ dot dot my old man, OMD/PhD in biology. Very much a red pill man. Everything that is bandied about these days in the red pill community, I heard from my old man some 25 years ago. almost verbatim. Yeah, I don't know what he's talking about with this [ __ ] but I can't get a logical argument out of him. He just makes emotional appeals. Lucas, was your first message via YouTube super chat? Cuz I don't see the first one, but um thank you for that. Did you find it? Not yet. We We'll give him time. We got chat. Jason Castle donated $100. Hey chat, is it too Andrew and maybe Brian not a real man? Feminist men like you. Pretty simple. Just kidding, Brian. Damn, that's crazy, Jay. Damn, Jason. What the [ __ ] Uh, is the TTS a little too loud, chat? Let me know if the TTS is a little too loud. We have Lucas with his followup. Thank you, Lucas. Thank you, Jason. Appreciate it. Chat, is it too loud? Let us know if it's too loud. We got another one coming in here in just a sec. Okay, Lucas donated $100. Thank you, Lucas. Three/ dot dot. Of course, like a young, dumb, naive 20-some year old bluepilled [ __ ] like yourself, I completely ignored the old man until I learned the hard way. Do you want to respond to Lucas? He called you. I'm I'm not scroll through it, but do you remember this conversation? Yeah. Do you know how long ago that was? A couple days ago. Two years ago. Okay. So, does this says two days ago for the record? Yeah, it got the clip got posted two days ago, but the conversation was from two years ago. You're so your channel posted a clip from two days ago where you said red pill communities are degenerating. I don't know. I don't even know if that was said. I'm just explaining to you that that's a really old conversation. You can play the audio on. I'm trying to find the date of the time. It's a long clip obviously. I think Well, I think it's two years ago or maybe a year and a half ago. I'm not sure. Yeah. Rick Rickus Morty, but I'm pretty sure it's not from from the last year. Well, while you're while you're looking for that, we have Charlie B. Can I send you the link? Donated $100. It's more people today are medicated. More people today are in therapy. Thank you, Charlie. How is it working? Explain the difference between anxiety/depression and the felling of the human condition. Okay, so yeah, we're definitely seeking more help than we ever have, which is why it seems like we're overly medicated, but it's because people are actually like trying to get the help for the first time. Anxiety is more a general worry about the future. It's this very general thing. And depression is more of a general overwhelming sadness that is is more than just the emotion. It's like you literally can't function in society. You just feel absolutely down. All right. Yeah. It's really interesting to me that the real Terry donated $100. Thank you, Real Ter. A good chunk of Andrew's viewers are redpilled men and women, and he does more for his audience than 99% of creators out there. Watch his reverse grift streams as one example. Yeah. He has no idea. He's never watched the show, right? I just pulling up a clip that from the show you said, right? Yeah. You watched a clip that from from how long ago? Two days ago. I'll just read from two days ago on this. Lucas, do I mean I got posted two days ago. You are creating a straw man character of what the red pill is. As Andrew said, the intellectual godfather of the so-called red pill, Roamasi is in a 30-year marriage with a 20some year old married daughter. For that matter, I would consider my Oh, he continued it on. Oh, he he continued. Okay, so the super chats that were marked two and three is following this super chat, the ones that came in through Streamlabs where he said, "My old man uh is very much a red pill man." And then three. Yeah, thank you, Lucas. Appreciate that. Sorry for the confusion there with the ordering on on these. Appreciate your support, man. Why don't we swap the chair?

When I first noticed I had issues doing things I enjoy, I turned to the VA. Psychology there used CBT and told me to just go out and do the things I enjoyed. There's nothing about how to do it. I'm not 100% uh PNT PNT disabled because of this worthless crap. Brian S, thanks for the YouTube super chat, man. Really appreciate. Brian, I'm sorry for that experience, but I highly recommend a book called uh Feeling Good by Dr. David Burns. It's a really good book on CBT and it's something you can enact on your own before you even seek therapy, but it is something that I highly recommend you read. All right, Raphael, we're going to swap chairs cuz this chair has been a little bit squeaky. Yeah. So, crazy to me with all this treatment available that when people were coming back shell shocked from world wars, they were unaliviving themselves less than they are right now at your age. Here, just pass it to her. Okay. Uh, here we have Joe. But true. Joe, thank you for the super chat. Appreciate it. Just a blank one. Appreciate it. Uh, we have Guy Sneeden. If you tuck that in, I don't date because three foes are trash. Conservative women are hard to find. Brian and Andrew are awesome. Guest, give your blue-haired wife my number. I'll show you what I'll show what a real man is. Do you want to respond to Guy Sne in here? Uh, and does your wife have blue hair? Uh, she doesn't. She has blonde hair. Beautiful blonde hair. But I will say that um the fact that you're calling women 304s indicates that you're probably single. Um, and I doubt you could pleasure a woman. Wow. Guy Sneeden says, "You're probably signal incapable of pleasuring a woman. Incapable of getting her." Okay, thank you. Uh, Guyen, if you want to respond, we got scurby. Exactly. Emotional appeal after emotional appeal. Yeah, I'm here for an emotional appeal. This guy has been making emotional appeal after emotional appeal, but can't back it up with logic. In fact, he said, "Foggic." Uh, that's where he lost the audience. He won't answer questions. Dude, you know that guys are bent towards logic. So why don't you make a effing argument? The argument is a lot of red pillars are isolated. They're angry. They blame women and they're dating less. I'm trying to help them stop doing that. And Red Pill content is pushing them further down the rabbit. Erroneous. Erroneous. It's not erroneous. It's literally factual. That's a That just so you know, that's still not actually an argument. That's just a statement. Well, it's a true statement. Well, but it doesn't tell us anything. Uh, we got to get back to it. So, were you able to find it or I'm going to move on to No shock. You couldn't find it. It's there. Andrew, if you give me another 10 minutes. How about that? We're in the middle of a No, he's he's saying this [ __ ] like trying to weasel out of it because he doesn't You know what, Brian? He doesn't want you to hear it. That's the reason. He doesn't want you to hear it. Well, you're a [ __ ] degenerate. He doesn't want you to hear it many times. I've told him to his [ __ ] face. He's a degenerate. So, you don't deny that you said red pill. Hold on, dude. So, you don't deny that red pill content creators are degenerates? Do you know what a degenerate? You just said it. You just said it, bro. Do you know what a degenerate is? I I have premarital sex. He thinks I'm a degenerate and red pill content promotes that. You also promote it. You're a [ __ ] degenerate. Okay, I'm a degenerate. Wait, are you against you? But I think red pill people are. So, what I'm saying, you don't believe in red pill communities. Oh my god. I How many times do I have to tell you this? But he's not You're not red pillar. I'm not a red pill, but you you you advocate for them. You literally go on their show. I advocate for the red pill, not for red pill. Excontent creator. Myron gains having sex out of marriage. [ __ ] degenerate. I've told him that to his face. Stop, bro. My turn. Shut up. Shut the [ __ ] up. And what messages are they promoting? And what messages are they promoting to their audience? When you're done filibusting, I'll And what messages are they promoting to their audience? Okay. What message? Go ahead, Andrew. Yeah. Yeah. So here, just so you know, are you going to insult? I've called most of these guys, hey, okay, most of these guys, but especially [ __ ] progressives like you degenerates because all of you who promote sex outside of marriage are [ __ ] degenerates from my view. Have you ever had sex out of marriage? Do you understand that you have sex out of marriage? Oh, so you're a degenerate? I was. Okay, good for you. You saved yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Were you Did you have something else there to go with like your little Did you own me? Do you feel like you owned me on that one? Little bit. A little bit. New prompts. New prompts here, guys. You feel like you got me on that? Yeah. Was Andrew Wilson completely consistent again? So, okay. Uh, in your, uh, Tik Tok bio, or this might be on your Instagram, you say, uh, masculinity, dating, and what women actually want, unfiltered, right? Uh, what do women actually want? I don't have a prescription for what women want. I ask them what they want and they tell me. That's all. And I share that information. That's it. I don't tell them anything. I don't prescribe anything. Do Do you Well, okay. I'm not going to um Let's go over some of the other prompts then. You have uh men uh healthy masculinity is expansive, not rigid. Can you just uh define what you mean by that? I guess. Where is that? Where did I say that? It was in one of the You said positive claims I would make in the debate. Healthy masculinity is expansive, not rigid. Can What do you mean by that? Yeah. I just don't subscribe to the idea that there's only one way to be considered quote unquote masculine. So like traditional gender roles, you would say uh traditional generals, you can be masculine and traditional general, but I think if you're not, that doesn't necessarily mean you're less masculine. For example, if your wife makes more money than you, I don't think that makes you less masculine. Okay, Andrew, the So the the positive claim he makes is healthy masculinity is expansive, not rigid. Is that something you want to bite on or Yeah, but you have to get into semantics. I don't want to get into semantics that I can't get a position. No, because for for the sake of the conversation. Will you get into semantics? I hear what you're saying, but do me do me a solid. But I get I get Are you Are you my homie? I We're homiesomies. We're homies. But what I'm saying is Andrew has these does these tactics, man. It's not about No, because but he's doing bad faith arguments, bro. Strawberry. I appreciate it. But he's doing bad faith arguments. He's doing bad faith. I haven't even made this. You will. I know you. So, I'm gonna make You're mad because I'm about Stop me from preemptively making an argument. Okay, let's let's get into it. Okay, let's do some answers. Do you like the lemonade, by the way? I just want to know what you mean by masculinity. What does that mean to you? Um, I don't have a solid definition. My general definition of masculinity, and it's very loose, is basically men doing the right thing because it's the right thing. And it's not the best definition because I don't think masculinity can be so defined. What? That's That's my definition. men doing the right thing because it's the right thing. Correct. What's the right thing? Um, protecting people, being good to people. That's what I think is masculine. Protecting people and being good to people. Mhm. Okay. But what does good to people mean? What does that mean? I'm not getting into morality. I'm not doing I'm not even getting That's where it goes. That's where it goes, Andrew. That's where it goes. No, I'm just asking what this what this means. I gave you my definition. Move on. Provide your definition. Provide whatever it is you want to do. Yeah. So, I can give you my definition of masculinity, but you haven't given me yours. I did. Go for it. So, it I I just want to make sure I got it right then, and I'm going to write down every word. Masculinity is men doing the right thing because it's the right thing, not for any sort of transaction or reward. Men doing the right thing because it's the right thing. Yes. Now, I need you to understand this. I know that you think that these are sneaky debate tricks, right? Even though I've sat across this table, this, by the way, is the first time ever that I've been in studio and had a a one-on-one debate where it's even been slightly heated. And usually we start serious where it's been a 1 v one, where it's even been Well, no, with the two degenerates. That was the only other time. Literally, that was the only other time in a 1 v one where it was even really Never gotten heated. You never got heated, dude. It was pretty tame. No, I'm serious. You've never gotten heated. No. What did I just say? Can you even repeat in a 101 debate? It's never been heated. No, no, no. What did I [ __ ] see? You don't even listening, dude. You don't even want to listen. This is the only one. He said in this studio this is the only one v one that I can think of where it's even gotten heated. Okay. Yeah, that's the that's the case. And usually it's because I clarify everything before we start talking about it. So, we're not talking past each other. Yeah. Cuz you love definitions. It's your favorite thing in the whole world. Dude, how do we know what we're talking about? You know what we're talking about. You just Yes, you do. Okay. Masculinity is men doing the right thing. Okay. Well, I think the right thing is for you to [ __ ] uh I don't know, punch yourself in the [ __ ] dick. Now do it. Great. So, you're So, you're feminine. You're feminine. Okay. Punch yourself in the dick or you're feminine. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cuz you're feminine. Good point. [ __ ] stupid, dude. You have to tell me what these things mean. Good point. Tell me what it means. What does it mean? What is the right thing? My definition. What is the right thing, bro? Doing it. Tell me your definition. What is the right thing? Tell me your definition. You haven't told me. Tell me your definition. Uh, I think Tell me your definition. I think that masculinity is when men. Tell me your definition. I just did. Okay. Well, I think masculinity is when men beat up women and kick them while they're down. That's the only way to be masculine. You say that in Jess, but a lot of truth is said in No, it's 100%. A lot of truth is said in chest. You got a lot of truth. A lot of [ __ ] you know, you got to really get in there. Yeah. Joking like that is, oh, that's coming from a real place from you. That's coming from a real place. That's coming from a real solid place. I mean, I would give you No, that's coming from the soul. Andrew, I'd give you a different That's coming from the soul. You ask me questions. That's coming from the soul. Ask me questions. Oh, man. You really You meant that. You meant that. Yeah. And then you got But you got to kick them when they're down. Yeah, of course. Yeah. You can't let the [ __ ] up. Yeah. It's just a joke, right? A lot of truth is said in the chest, Andrew. Yeah. Is it? Absolutely. Like when you were like before the show started and you were making Kate shows about yourself. Is that where you tried to tell me something? I never once did that. What? Oh, come on, dude. What? Did he just really make that up? just to say some [ __ ] Dude, did I did I miss something? Everybody missed it cuz it never [ __ ] happened. What I'm pointing out to you, right, is when you're bad faith like this, I'm going to be bad faith back. Okay, go for it then. You've been bad faith this whole time. There's no, bro, asking you bad faith. Asking you about your proprietary [ __ ] definition. I gave you my definition. I'm not going to go into morality because then it becomes I'm not even going into morality. I'm just asking what you ask somebody what good is. When you ask somebody what is good, is that not morality? They define the [ __ ] thing by what is good. Then I have to ask you what good is. You [ __ ] dot. But that's what I'm saying. I'm not [ __ ] I'm not going to get into morality with you because it's the same [ __ ] every time with you. This is your favorite argument is morality. Then what? You should just look at the camera and monologue, dude. I will. I'm not debating. I'm just screaming. I got to prompt change then. Um Well, he doesn't want to define masculinity. He only wants to, you know, pick apart our mind. You haven't even defined it. Sure. You just gave a proprietary definition. It's your positive claim. So what? Yeah, but I have to define it for him. I defined it. I have to define it for him. I defined it. You didn't, dude. Did he define it? No, he No, it makes satisfied with it. Listen, it's circular. Masculinity is men doing the right thing. That [ __ ] doesn't tell us anything because I don't have a very prescriptive version of masculinity. That is my general. So then it would be to ask follow-up questions about what the right thing is. You don't want to get morality, but you don't want to tell me any [ __ ] answers to any questions. here. Well, if if you don't want to get into the morality, can you say you said it's uh healthy masculinity is expansive. Andrew's got to take a little smoke break here. Little smoke break because Andrew thinks masculinity is very rigid. If you don't fall within these guidelines, pretty [ __ ] If you don't if you don't fall, be nice. Come on. If you don't fall within these certain guidelines, it's you're not masculine. That's Andrew's take. Okay. Well, while Andrew is getting a little a little smoke break, we are going to let some chats come through. By the way, guys, actually, you know what? pull up Twitch because we need to do a little Twitch shout out. Guys, go to Twitch. Uh, pull up the actual Twitch tab in the window tab.

Uh let's see if we have Oh, we got some chats. Hang on. Hang on. Let me just let me just try this again. Yes. Go ahead. If if you are talking about something and making a prescriptive ought in this case masculinity, right? What what it is and what men should be doing with it. I didn't say they should be. I said that's my worldview. Okay. Your worldview. Mhm. Great. If we dive into your worldview, right, and you have a proprietary definition. This this definition meets no definition of masculine I've ever seen in my life. I know. Okay. Yes. So, it's proprietary. You agree? Yes. So, it's perfectly rational and logical for me to go through your proprietary definition so that I can make sure it makes [ __ ] sense, right? I don't care if you think it makes sense. Give me a [ __ ] shot, dude. I can't I can't I give him the bottle. You want the bottle? How much is left? [ __ ] you probably that chatter, the one chatter is actually right. You might be the dumbest [ __ ] person I've ever debated on this podcast. And you're the most emotional wreck of a person I've ever seen. You'd be emotional, too, if you're This like arguing with a [ __ ] kindergarter, dude. You don't even know what you're talking about. Can you pass her the You like literally don't know what you're talking about. I don't care. The whole point of the I don't care. The whole point of the prompt was masculinity isn't a rigid thing, and that's why I keep it very open. Yeah. Okay. It's not a rigid thing, but that doesn't tell us what it is. Okay. All right. Uh let's see here. We have We'll do a couple chats here really, then get we'll get right back into a prompt. We have Red Fox. Thank you, Red Fox. Appreciate it. Red Fox donated $100. Andrew holds a deep veneration for women and their contributions traditions deepen feminist. What is the role and duty of women? Back my religion. We venerate the theotokos. You know that would be the mother of God. But you know the thing is is even though I talk about this all the time, discuss how much we need matrons in society, how important it is, I just hate all [ __ ] women. No, you see them as just breeders. That's what you see them as. Yeah. Well, it's just breeders. That's what he said. Do you think women have any duty to No. No. No. Do men have duties? Sorry. Yeah. No. Yeah. Men don't have duties. No. I think by my definition, they should do the right thing. But that's my belief. That would be a duty. [ __ ] adult. Okay, fine. Yeah. So, what what duty? So, they have the duty to do the right thing. Let's let's not do insults. No, let's do insults. What do What is What What duties do men have to do the right thing? That's That's my view worldview. So, they have duties. What women What What duties do women have? None. No. Okay. Okay. We have a couple chats coming through here. We got Where is it? Jordan. It drives you insane. Yes, it does. Drives him insane. Jordan Flores donated $100. Andrew, I'm sorry. As a member of the Mexican community, we don't claim the Fender General Vivo Crucible. Are you part of that? Maybe. I'm half Mexican. You could be Puerto Rican. You could be I'm half Mexican. Okay. But I would imagine the he's apparently Jordan Flores is the representative of all Mexicans who've ever lived. He works on the consulate. Yeah. No. Um he absolutely is probably another one of these single people that are angry. So it's fine. Okay. I mean you're married and seem pretty angry between the two of us. I'm the one that seems angry. Andrew between the two of us 100 times the women you have. So his sample size is far greater. Shouldn't you defer to that then since you love moo studies so much? Shout out. You've interviewed a lot. Two I think 2,000. Jeez. 2000 when I know that's a lot. That was kind of misogynistic. And I've been here. What have you learned? I've been here for like half of that. By the way, why did you Why did you say G's when I interviewed 2,000? I'm just saying that's a lot of That seems a bit misogynistic. How so? It just seems a bit like wow, you had to talk to 2,000 women. I'm just surprised at the sheer number of women you've talked to. No, the way it came the way it came across. Sure, but I'm explaining was it it was like I'm sorry that you had to. It wasn't that. I'm just asking you what you've learned in those 2,000 interviews. What have you learned from them? Yeah. Not a lot about women? Not much. No, just kidding. I've learned a I've learned a lot. Yeah, I've learned a ton. What have you learned? Share share something. Ask me at the end of the show and I'll tell you. I don't want to I shouldn't be too involved in the convo. Hey, you donated $100. The red pill isn't the problem. It's a symptom of a larger issue where men have had negative experiences with modern women and are still villainized. We find solidarity in our collective awakening. Thank you. Hey, you. This is exactly what I think is an honest assessment of what happens. I said in my opening statement that red pill communities prey on men's rejection. They prey on men's anger. And I think that's true. And I think they do find community in Red Pill. I really do. And I think that's why they flock there. But I don't think it's effective for them. I think it's keeping them lonely, isolated, and angry, and they're not dating. So, if it's not working, let's look for an alternative. That's all I'm saying. Here, let's get into that. What's the alternative? That's what we've been trying to get into this whole time. You're trying to do some other [ __ ] semantic definition. Okay. Okay. Listen, me asking you what masculinity is and you're saying fulfilling the general societal good [ __ ] is meaningless. It is meaningless. Okay? Because I didn't come here to necessarily to talk about that. I came here to talk about the Redfield community is destroying men's world. Debates are about world views. No, debates. You play debate club and I'm not here for that. Dude, it's not debate club. You try to win debate points. Like there's some judges out there. That's what you do. You're not trying to have a real conversation about [ __ ] Yeah, I agree that I want my worldview to win and I want my worldview to win a debate. But the thing is is like I don't even know what your worldview is cuz you can't explain it. So your worldview is the red pill is working for men. Is that your worldview? Well, that's what we're here arguing. Okay. If you want to do an eternal critique of Christian ethics and my worldview, I'm happy to do that. We came here to talk about the red pill and manosphere community. Yes. And so when you're asking me about the red pill, what have I told you it is? You said it's a data packet. Yes. And so I can utilize and Christians can utilize this data packet as well, right? And we can introduce it through Christian ethics in a prism that helps men, right? Only through Christian ethics. That's what I would prescribe. Yeah, but most people in red pill communities aren't Christian Orthodox. They don't have to be Christian Orthodox. Well, the point is, is the red pill community helping men or is it hurting? Hold on. Is it Is the red pill community helping men or is it hurting them in your opinion? Ultimately, I think it's more helpful than it's bad. Okay. Yeah. But I would like to know what the alternative is. Turn off the red pill. At least for now. That's the only thing I What's the alternative to it, though? Um I don't know. Consider trying to ask a girl out. Um maybe. Yeah, they never thought of that. They're not doing it, Andrew. Yeah, dude. Bro, you literally just said with that chatter. Yeah. That you agreed with his definition of what it was, what the problem was. I didn't say anything about definition. Hang on. Hang on. That the way he said the problem was, which is that they had bad experiences with women. Correct. That means they're asking them out. Not necessarily. Then how are they having bad experiences with women? Maybe they're not getting success on dating apps. I don't know. That doesn't necessarily mean they're going up to women in the street and asking them out. So they're so so they're they're having issues approaching women. Yes, they're having issues dating with women. Yes, men feel rejected. So, what's the alternative? The alternative is hopefully more uh positive content coming out. I hope my channel helps. I hope other channels help. It doesn't It's not telling me anything. What's the alternative? I don't have the definite alternative, but I think the red the point is the red pill community is hurting men. The red pill community is hurting people. That's all I'm talking about. But you said you were here to discuss the alternative. I didn't say when did I say I was here to say I literally just wrote down alternative because you said right I have an alternative. I said seek out alternative. What's the alternative? I don't know but there's not the red pill. If it's not working get away from it. If it's poison stop taking it. That's the first [ __ ] step. Would you agree? Not a single alternative. If you're taking like I said there's positive masculinity podcast out there that I would recommend listening to. Whoa. Really? Wait. Positive masculinity. Okay. What is that? Um, not the rigid sense that the red pill uh prescribes. Anything anything counter the red pill. Anything. Okay, I'll just call it blue pill for the sake of your stupid definitions. I'll call it blue pill. Blue pill. The opposite of red pill. How about that? Okay. Well, what are they saying? They're saying don't take the red pill. That's what they're saying. Okay, got it. So, let me ask you a question. This is a a cool red pill talking point. I wonder if you can refute it. Do you think that um that men care about body count? I think some of them do. Yeah. Would you? No. No, you wouldn't care. I wouldn't. If she had [ __ ] 20,000 guys if I loved her, I wouldn't care. You wouldn't care. 30? There's no number. If I love somebody, I don't care. I don't care. Yeah. What if she had sucked 20 guys dicks at once? Do you think that's going to change my answer? I'm just curious. I've already answered it. If I cared about somebody, I don't care. No matter what. Correct. As long as I don't have an STD, I don't care. Do you think it's a legitimate preference that men have that they don't want women with high body counts? I think any preference is legitimate. If somebody has a preference, they have a preference. So, so do you think that that's a legitimate preference? Sure. I I said any preference is legitimate. Remember when I said that? And then what do you think most men would consider a high body count to be? I have no clue. I don't I have no clue. How would I know that? Okay, fair enough. Do you think that most men would maybe consider 10 would probably be pretty high? Not necessarily. No. Not in 2025. No. You don't You don't think so? I don't. You don't think that that men would have a preference against being with a woman who's [ __ ] 10 different dudes before them? Some men would, but not all men. Yeah. So, the men who would find that revolting, what do you think they should do in 2025 when you just said there's not very many women who haven't had that? Find I didn't say there's not that many women that haven't had that. I'm saying that that isn't necessarily body count for some people. I didn't say every woman has that body count. You didn't say every. Well, then they should find somebody that doesn't have that body count. That's what they What if Okay, but what if it's the case that an overwhelming majority of women have that body count? Then men are [ __ ] out of luck, I guess. Is that what you're saying? So, how are you helping them? I'm saying that I don't think that's the case. If that is the case and men don't want to change their preference, then they won't find anyone today. So, you're So, you're saying that if they have a preference against this, that they should just change their preference. I didn't say that. So, what should they do? If they if if every woman is disqualified, then they're not going to date. So, so if if it is the case then that promiscuity increases in society, which that's what the trends are showing, you at least agree with that. Promiscuity, the trends show that that has been drastically increasing over the last I said I don't think it's that drastically different than it was when we were in college. So, no. Okay. You don't think that you you don't think like of has increased since you were in college? It doesn't necessarily mean they're banging a bunch of other dudes. Porn has been around for a long time. Yeah, but the the thing is is the individualized form of it has not. Yeah, but they're often with their own partners and stuff, so it doesn't matter. No, they do BGV been around for a long time. You remember all them? Like it's been around. Not even close to the same rates, dude. Okay. It's been around. Do you ever think we've been in in a situation like with Zoomers where it could be as as many as one in 10 women do porn ever? Okay. Ever? Like [ __ ] ever. Okay. Those are OF people. That doesn't mean general women. There are average people get married every day. Andrew, it's not marriage is decreasing. But it's still average people get married every day. Even if they're listen, it happens. So people are finding these people that aren't alive. I agree that you should be going for good marriages, but here's where our problem. you should be going for good marriages. But here's my problem. My problem is is when we get into the preferences of men, when you say we should be looking for alternatives, let's have alternatives to red pill for men who have preferences. I disagree with you and I think body count matters to men in a big way. To some men, yes. Yeah. And I want to know what you would tell those men to do. What would you tell them to do? Um, if they're religious, they probably can find somebody in their church that doesn't have a high body count. I'm sure they can meet people when they're young and in college because like college people are dating and get married. There's probably younger women out there that if you date them, there's a lot of people that get married. What about the 30-y olds? They're not all I mean they're they don't necess not all women have high body count. So I don't But you make it sound like they do because that's still like your your stick. That's what that's what you do is make men think that all women are, you know, you're just saying that don't you don't you think that by the time most women are 25, they've had at least three sexual partners at least by the Maybe three. Maybe three. At least three. I'll grant three. At least three. I'll grant three. Yeah. So So at least three. I don't say at least. I'll grant three. You'll grant three, but you won't grant five. I can go to five. Okay. Five. And don't you think that once you start getting into those numbers, we're we're in like high body count territory for a lot of men. It depends on what their preference is. I have no idea. If their preference is that they don't want a woman who slept with five men before them or had and remember this too, a lot of these times you're sleeping with these these women are sleeping with these men. They're long-term relationships, right? So, you think that if men have legitimate preferences against all that baggage, right? You think they should be alone? No. I think they should find somebody that doesn't have that baggage if that's what matters to them. Do you think you think that there's enough of those out there for the amount of men? I do. You do? And you think that those women want those men? I think average people get married every day. Okay. Well, yeah, that's not my question. Well, it answers your question. So then how come how come you think that these uh these incelss can't find the women uh which are based around their preferences? Then I think a lot of people um either stay in their house and don't get out. They don't meet people. They don't ask people out in high school. They don't ask people out in college. I think that's a big problem with men today is that they're not asking women out. I think that's a big big issue. Okay. What So, we'll just finish with this real quick and then I'll tie it all together for you. What do you consider a marriageable woman for the average man? What is marriageable? I can't prescribe that. I have no idea. Well, what do you think the average man would consider marriageable? Oh, someone they really enjoy being around. I don't know. That's what I think they're looking for. Well, there's going to be some things that you would agree with me. They have to be like they probably have to be attracted to them. Sure. Right. A trait like that. They probably have to be attracted. Sure. But there's But attraction comes in many ways. Well, they'd have to probably be physically attracted to each other, right? To some degree. But personality and humor can win a lot of people over. Yeah. But you still have to be attracted to a person to want to [ __ ] them. There's a lot of average people that get married every day, Andrew. Yeah. But that doesn't mean that they're not attracted to the other people. Okay. They could be attracted beyond physical looks. It It's It happens all the time. Yeah. But the thing is just like it's really hard for a man's we need to get hard if it if if you're not physically not. It's not. It's really not. So if you're not So you [ __ ] women you're not physically attracted to? I'm saying most men find most women attractive. You You think that men [ __ ] women they're not attracted to? I think they find most women attractive. Yeah. So like, so so you think then that like um that men can just will themselves to [ __ ] attractive women? It's called a slump buster. Yeah. I think a lot of men find a lot of women attracted. And do you think they want long-term relationships with those women? Yes. Cuz they get married every day. Average people get married every day. Average doesn't mean you're not attracted to them, though. You keep on you make you're making a conflation. Yeah. So like they have to be attracted at least, right? Sure. There has to be some attraction. But again, some physical attraction. Sure. Okay. And do you think that there's like I don't know an obesity epidemic? Sure. Yeah. And so doesn't that lower the rates of attract? But aren't the 600 lb ladies married? Like you know, aren't they married? Like it can happen. Yeah. But they're usually married to like very very unattractive men as well, right? They're attracted to them. So what does it matter? No, they're not always attracted to each other. So they got married just for what? No, no, no. Sometimes it happens in the marriage. Okay. Right. Sometimes it happens in the marriage. They literally grow apart. The point is people can find other people attractive. People want to spend their lives with people, but you don't want to push that message. No. What do you What do you mean? I'm just talking about basic laws of attraction. Do you at least agree there has to be a trade of attraction? Sure. But if 600 if 600 lb people can find a partner, then I think a lot of people can find a partner. One second. I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on here. Oh, good. Quick little guys, we're like 300 viewers away from 10,000 concurrent on YouTube. Guys, if you're watching, help us hit help us peak at 10,000. So anyway, yeah. So, back to this. So, we agree that there's at least one trait. Are there any other traits for marriageable women? Uh, sorry, repeat the question. I'm not really sure. We agree there's at least one trait. There has to be attraction. Is there any other men? You're saying men need to find a woman attractive. That's one of the criteria. It's well, at least one we could agree on. There there has to be attraction. Some attraction. Yes. Okay. What else for a marriageable woman? Um, I think if they enjoy being around the person, I think that's a big personality, humor, like same interest. I think those are a big factor. Yeah. Okay. They enjoy each other's company. Correct. That's a big part of living together. Okay. But, uh, so they enjoy each other's company. What else? Um, I don't know. They have similar values. Um, similar values. They agree on similar household duties, things like that. Okay. So, I agree. I would say that that that one you nailed right there, similar values is the thing that I hear the most from both men and women. Yeah. Right. Similar values. So if you were to like I don't know ask a woman for instance about her political takes and they were completely the opposite of yours. Yeah. Right. You probably wouldn't want to be with that woman. Probably not. And you probably shouldn't. So like if you thought for instance that women shouldn't vote, right? And they thought that they should. Yeah. You probably shouldn't date that person. Yeah. So it seems like it's a pertinent dating question now. Uh no. I'm saying that in red pill. The only people who think women should invote are red pill people. So, I'm saying if they can get out of the red pill community, they wouldn't be But you just said that preferences are a thing which are completely fine and you have no problem with anybody's preferences about anything. Okay. Yeah. If these people similar values, if they're like, "Hey, I don't think women should have the right to vote or I don't I don't think women should work," then yeah, go ahead and go ahead and whittle those people out of your life, go for it. So, just to make sure, right? You think that if it's your preference that you shouldn't be with women like that? What percentage of the population? What percentage of the population you the red pillars and those are the men you're trying to save? They're the only ones that are aren't those the men you're trying to save. Yeah, absolutely. Well, but if their preference is to have these types of women, why do you think them? Why do you think they don't want women to vote? Well, I think that there's a they have good justifiable reasons for why they don't want anybody to vote. Okay, that's what I think. Well, like I said, those are all the things that would make somebody I think viable. And if they don't match the So how you going to Well, how you going to save these guys if they have these preferences? I don't get it. Didn't they find somebody? Your wife doesn't care about voting, right? You found somebody. Yeah, I did. Do you think there's a lot of my wives out there? I don't think there's a lot of you's out there. Well, but there's a lot of red pillars, right? Yeah, but I don't think there's I don't think every single red pillar thinks they shouldn't vote. The women should have vote. You somehow that somehow you landed on that somehow and you found somebody who agrees with you. Um, so I hope she convinced me. Yeah. Okay. Well, I have hope that other guys can too then. Okay. So then inside of the of the red pill community though, you do agree that there's like a massive repeal the 19th movement. Sure. And and if they find women that agree, good for them. I hope they do. But they don't but they but they probably won't, right? Okay. Well, then they're they're going to be alone then. So So then you don't really care about the loneliness of red pillars. You just want them to change their preferences to meet your preferences. There's a lot of people there's a lot of red pillars that might change their whole belief system after getting out of it. Go ahead. Change my belief system. and say I'm Why is it that red pillars should get with women who want the right to vote? I didn't say that. That that's not what you have no prescriptions. You have no [ __ ] prescriptions. It's like talking. Listen. No, you listen. No, you listen. You've been talking a [ __ ] prescription. I just talked to you like that. What are you going to [ __ ] do about it? Nothing. Yeah, you heard me. You [ __ ] heard me. You're not going to do [ __ ] Not trying to What are you trying to do? Now, back to this. What are you trying to do here? Nothing. Yeah. You want to come hard? We're doing it, right? Coming hard by what? I you just said don't you just said what are you gonna do right what are you okay what are you gonna do dude that is some insecurity I wouldn't say anything about that are you now are you gonna engage here or not repeal the 19th I don't think we should got it if you had a preference for it okay and a woman didn't probably shouldn't date right right that would make it a legitimate dating question that doesn't but that's not what you just said you said I don't care about red pillars because they if they can't find a woman that uh yeah you want them to conform to your preferences I didn't say conform to my preferences I said if they get out of the red pill community, they might not believe these things anymore. That's all I'm saying. Which would conform to to what? Your preferences. I didn't say anything about my preferences. You if the red pill if all these red pillars adopted your preferences like they don't care about body counts. I don't [ __ ] about my preferences. Who cares about my preferences? If they can't find a woman, Hold on. If they listen, if they can't find a woman, if they can't find a woman that doesn't match their preferences, they get out of the red pill because it's not working for them. They might change their beliefs. I'm not prescribing a preference. I'm prescribing getting out of the red pill. That's what I'm prescribing. So, can you prescribe any alternative? Getting out of the red pill is the first step. Yeah, that's not an alternative. It is. No, that's just that. Listen, it's like saying this. Um, can your car is [ __ ] Great, but I need to drive to work. Can you tell me an alternative car? No. That's not the same thing. I'm saying no, it's not. Okay, take the blue pill then. How about that? Okay. What's the blue pill? It's the complete opposite of the red pill. Yeah, that doesn't tell me anything. What is it? Okay. Well, you'll they'll figure it out. Okay, they'll figure it out. Never any prescriptions at all. No, cuz I'm not coming here to prescribe anything but getting out of the red pill. That's all. But don't you understand that unless you give prescriptions for why that is? Because it's not helping them. That's why. Yeah. But you won't even tell us what the standard of helping them is. What is it? If they're unhappy with the current situation they're in because of the communities they're listening to, get out of it. Tell us what the alternative community they'll be happy in. First, throw up the red pill. That's the first step. Then we'll figure out if you're not happy with your shitty car, then just get rid of the car. What do I What do I get in? Nothing. Yeah. Nothing. Yep. Stupid. Stupid. It's so stupid. Yeah, it is. It's so dumb. You have no alternatives. It's so dumb. Yeah. No prescription. Keep prescribing the red pill then. Keep prescribing it. It's working for them. I I prescribe Christian ethics. You also prescribe the red pill. No, I just say that there's things about the red pill. You ask me a specific narrow question. Has it done more good or more bad? I think it's done more bad. That doesn't mean it's a prescriptor that I prescribe because I also understand it does more good than bad. Okay. Well, you personally don't, but the communities themselves do and the content creators do. What does it have to do with anything? What does that have to do with literally [ __ ] anything? It has to do with what my came here to do. Okay. What did you come here to do again? To try to convince as many red pillars to get out. Do you think you're doing that? I don't know. Maybe some people are listening. Do you think you're doing that? I don't know. Maybe some of them might say, "You know what? It isn't working for me. I'm going to get out." Maybe that's what they're thinking. You would have been better coming in with a pro-Christian ethics message because that actually gets him out of the red pill. Okay. Sure. Yeah, it does. It does it a lot better. Yeah. That's why Muslims do a good job recruiting out of the red pillar manosphere. It's why Christians do a good job. Secularist atheists who say, "Ah, no. I don't give a [ __ ] if a woman's [ __ ] plowed 100 guys, I'd still be with her anyway." That just turned off every [ __ ] who who is watching this, I promise. Well, that's fine. But if if it is going to Christian ethics and that gives them a happier life and they're not depressed and they're not incels, then hey, go for it. That's a prescription. Wait a second. So maybe we can agree here. Should red pillars go towards Christian ethics? I'm not prescribing that. No. But if it helps them, go for it. If then that would be a prescription. No, it's not. There's several things they can turn to that aren't Christian ethics. But if that is one of them, I'm not saying that there's I don't know. But I'm saying there are other alternatives. If Christian ethics is one, if you said if religion in general is one alternatives, what I got here, there's other alternatives. Yeah. There's several people that live their lives in a secular way that aren't depressed and and you know, incels. There's several ways you can live a secular life that doesn't necessarily have this hard and fast philosophy that you believe in. Uhhuh. There are people that can get out of it and choose a different path. That's all I'm saying. Yeah. You're just all you're offering up is more feminist degeneracy. Yeah. Degenerate. It is degenerate. I'm not promoting any sort of degeneracy. What your worldview leads to is cohabitation and single motherhood and degeneracy. That's all it ever leads to. And what red pill content leads to is depression. and red pill content leads to depression and it leads to loneliness and it leads to anger. Here's the thing. If you have to do the alternative spectrum where we follow your view for cohabitation, we already know what that does to men and it's way worse than if they never get married or if they do get married. We know it for sure. And your worldview, your secularist [ __ ] worldview, feminist worldview is what led us to this in the first place. It was the erosion of religion, the erosion of Christian ethics, the erosion of uh having a patriarchal society. We used to have 95%. 95% they stayed intact. Thanks, man. Oh, now you care about them so much. 95% what? Oh, marriages. You 95%? Because women were legally and economically trapped. Oh, you think this is a better system? Yes. Okay. Well, then why do you say you care about these men? Yes. You You want them to be free of the red pill? Correct. Then why'd you put them in a [ __ ] society where they needed it? Okay, that's Yeah, they needed it because of feminism. You're right. Blame women every chance you get. Blame women every chance you get. Andrew, did I blame women or did I blame an ideology? Okay. It's the same thing. No, it's not the same thing. You just don't understand how to know nothing. So again, this whole society, we had all of the things that you're prescribing. Men's health really good. Women's health really good. Yeah, it really was. And now not so much. Thanks to you [ __ ] Yeah. Thanks to us. So you want them to do the exact same [ __ ] Same [ __ ] Cohabitate, have kids, let the woman take over when it comes to uh abortions, right? She can kill your kid, not kill your kid. Totally up to her. You [ __ ] deal with it. And if she has a high body count, just get over that preference. Yeah. If the red pill's working for you, if the red pill is working for you, keep it. If it's not, get the [ __ ] out. Well, here's the thing. Your lifestyle doesn't the lifestyle secularism, which leads to the to um to degeneracy, is what forced society into to this [ __ ] play. Anyway, so you know what for I think a lot of men are angry that women have agency and they can live their own lives. they can make income and these men are just upset about it. That's what it is. And the red pill was a good community for them to go to because they're rejected and they're angry. So the red pill is what it is. Yeah. So it's it has nothing to do with agency. It has to do with the uh understanding of virtues. Oh yeah. It's virtues. That's the issue. Everyone's like, man, you think you think that gender is nebulous. In fact, everything is nebulous. You're So when you say masculine or you say feminine, those are nebulous terms to you. But the thing is is like masculinity is not a nebulous term. It's always been associated with virtue. The same as femininity, feminine virtues and masculine virtues. The world changes. Yeah. But the thing is it's like that forcing of the prog of of progression ideology, progressive ideology. Exactly what got us here. And all you're prescribing is more progressive ideology. Yeah. The idea that women wanted to, you know, be lawyers and they couldn't 55 years ago. Yeah. Oh my god. Instead, they took care of their own children. We're forcing it. Oh, we're forcing it down your throat. Oh my god. Let me ask you this. God forgive people try to find their own. Would you rather this? Would you rather take away the ability of women to be lawyers if it meant that the human population continued to go cuz they stayed at home or were mothers? Or would you let humanity go extinct so that women could stay lawyers if they wanted to? I don't know if a life is worth living if you don't have agency. That's what I said. I just No, I don't. I would rather women had the choice. That's what I said. And all of humanity go extinct. So be it. Okay, I think that's the end of the debate. There's some other punks. Uh, we got some chats coming through, guys, if you want to get it in. $100 TTS. Andrew's going for another smoke break. There he goes. Uh, he'll be right back, guys. We have Lucas. Thank you, Lucas. Lucas donated $100. Appreciate it. Healthy masculinity equals biblical masculinity, i.e. highly competent, patriarchal/familyoriented, honorable, unassalably virtuous, courageous, with impeccable integrity. Doesn't that sound like my definition a little bit beyond the Bible? Is is that your definition? Doing the right thing cuz it's the right thing. Like uh you know, family oriented, honorable, virtuous, courageous, impeccable, integrity, I don't know. Okay, we have Jason Castle here. Thank you, Jason. Appreciate it. Jason Castle donated $100. Like I said, definitely one of the dumbest guys Andrew has ever debated. In order to have an actual debate, you need to understand your opponent's worldview that includes their definition. Dummy. I didn't come here to play the definition game. That's Andrew's little tactic he does with every debate. That's why these are five hours. Yeah. But I mean, don't you think it's fair that in order for you guys to have an understanding of what you're actually talking about, you both can agree on a definition? Yeah, I do agree. But there's there's things that I think are are given that he tries to nitpick anyway. Like for example, if I said I think women historically would be oppressed, he would say, "Well, what's oppression?" And then it's like he knows what oppression is, but he wants to play this semantic game which leads us down a road which makes him win argument points, but it's like we both agree that women have been oppressed at some point. So that's he might disagree, but I I agree with you that he knows what well he has his own sense of or his own definition of oppression, but he's just looking to you to give your own definition to make sure that you guys are talking about the same thing. For example, uh how would you uh and I'm not debating on Sure. Sure. No, I think I like this conversation. No, for sure. How would you how would you define racism? Um I define racism as a systematic discrimination due to someone's identity mostly. Like I think prejudice and racism are two different things. But for example, some people and I don't know if you use this definition will use the following definition of racism. Racism equals prejudice plus power. Yeah, I I I can I can agree with that. Is that your definition? Yeah, I can I can agree with that. Yeah. But many people in the original definition of racism, that's not the original definition of racism. So that's why I think he's trying to figure out the definitions of words because especially with words like oppression, racism, sexism. If Oh my god, I am. Is that really I have not been talking into the mic the entire time. I had it turned around. So I hope probably nobody heard what I was saying. Um my apologies. So the definition of racism, if it's prejudice, racism equals prejudice plus power. Uh, Andrew is not going to agree with you on that definition, right? But instead of providing his own definition, he wants to pick apart mine. And I think that's the [ __ ] that he does in debates. If you don't agree with my definition, provide your own. Huh? You mean you win? No, you're winning debate club. I'm trying to have a conversation. You don't know what a conversation is. You don't even have a worldview that's informed. Okay. All you're doing is prescribing degeneracy. All you do is believe in Christian ethics cuz it's your go. The thing that worked for 2,000 years. Oh, it's it worked so well. Yes, it did. For years. Why aren't we doing it still? We we're trying to move society to it. It's not going there. Yeah. Whatever. Half the world by 2050 they're secularists are going to be more popular. By 2050 they can't reproduce stupid. They can't they can't [ __ ] We're the ones [ __ ] They're not. No, they're not. Do you want to know? Do you want to take a breakdown of population by secularists versus Christians? Not even from the same [ __ ] universe, dude. Okay. Okay. Really quick, really quick before we get right back into it. I just want to read Dude, I you got to let me go get some sleep, man. It's 24 hours. cuz I've been up now. How long have we been doing this? Uh, like hours. 3 hours. It's time. It's time. We got to wrap it on this, bro. I'll be back tomorrow, though. 30 minutes. 30 minutes. 30 minutes. Okay, 30 minutes. Let me let at least let the chats come through really quick, guys. Okay, 30 minutes. Uh, so yeah, we'll do 30 minutes if you want. Final time, final opportunity. $99 TTS. Also, really quick, guys. We're like 200 viewers away from hitting 10,000 concurrent viewers. Let me ask you this, too. Join us really quick. Is there any degeneracy you're against? Any? I'm sure. Like homosexuality? No, I'm not against that. Female promiscuity? No, I'm not against that. Okay. Um, are you against male promiscuity? No. Okay. No male promiscuity. Are you against uh like three men in a homosexual relationship adopting a child? No. No, not against that either. Um, what degeneracy would you be against? I can give me examples. I'll tell you. Maybe necroilia. Like what? What? You draw the line at dead bodies. That's one. That's it. I That's the one I could think of. I'm sure there's more. What about incest? Uh, yeah. I I think that's degeneracy. You think that is? Yeah. So, can you tell me why it is you think two brothers shouldn't be able to have sex? It just doesn't sit right with me. No. Okay. It just doesn't. And none of this sits right with anybody. The idea The idea that you So, all you've prescribed for society is the same exact thing that these guys have been dealing with for the last 50 years, which is just an unlimited amount of degeneracy. What new? You know what? Let me just ask this. What new are you actually bringing to the table? Are you bringing any new idea other than just I'm a progressive and do whatever the [ __ ] you want? Are you bringing anything? I think my channel is showing that the red pill myths that they're being told about women isn't necessarily true. So, I'm bringing that and people have told me that it's helping. So, okay. That's what I'm bringing to the table. Well, it looks to me like all you're bringing to the table is just more progressive degeneracy. It looks to me like all you're bringing to the table is a return to the 1950s. No, I'm Well, here's the thing. 1950s so good, right? Hey, in the 1950s, what did you think about the lack of mental illnesses there? Yeah, I'm sure there weren't any mental illnesses or maybe we didn't know how comparison to the 1950s were so great. Let's just go back. What was so what what about the interpersonal relationships in the 1950s did you hate so much? What were they? You don't know, do you? Yeah. You don't know. No. All you bring to the table is let's go back in time. That's all you bring to the table. Oh, I'm sorry. You're You're upset that I used tradition. Do I seem upset? What's What's a tradition? Do I seem upset? Yeah. It seems like an experiment that worked. Oh, did it? Yeah. That's what a tradition. Do you have family traditions? Not really. None? Not that I can think of. No. Oh. Would you agree with me that a tradition could easily be looked at as an experiment which worked? Not necessarily. Well, I mean, why would you have them if they don't work? I don't know. Is the Christmas tree a tradition? Does it work? Yes, it works. And here's what it works for. Has no application. It works for the assistance of people getting around a Christmas tree and celebrating an event. Yeah. And it works so well that it spread like wildfire and everybody started doing it. It was a great way to assist with community. Seems like a tradition that worked. Richard Dawkins, who was a very famous atheist, said he really misses Christmas carols. He did everything he could to eliminate Christianity, but he really misses Christmas carols. Yeah. Well, you can celebrate Christmas without being Christian. Sure. You're just going to steal from our ethics like always. And then, you know, degenerize them. Yeah, sure. But Okay. Did you want them? By the way, I order food. I I was going to get us food after the show or No, I need sleep. No, just checking. I was going to I was going to order some food, Andrew. Going to get you a burger. All right. Let me let the chats come through. Uh, I'm sure the audience can tell I'm [ __ ] tired, too. Christopher Scott donated $100. And I wonder why men feel disheartened in society. Could it be the solid 20 to 30 years of telling them they're monsters? predators and # unalive all men. No, it's all Red Pill's fault. I think that's horrible. I don't think people should make men feel terrible, but I think what's happening with Red Pill is that it's becoming a dehumanization of women and it's becoming demonizing women and I don't think that's going to help either. So, I don't agree that men should be berated like that, but I also don't think women should either. Okay, we have Jordan Flores here. This is the Mexican guy. Jordan Flores donated $100. The representative of married for 10 years and four kids. Again, Andrew, not all of us Mexicans are as stupid as this one. Some of us understand how to follow a simple argument. You got something to say about Mexicans? Yes. What is it? Go ahead. The mic's right there. Well, I'm not going to say they're all stupid as you. What the [ __ ] Oh, whoops. Uh, okay. I'm not going to say that. That's too much. But like the term stupid Mexican is pretty funny. It's pretty funny, dude. If you want to help sincerely, then try to understand sincerely. Andrew brings up good points and you remain evasive. It doesn't help anyone. Well, as I was telling uh Brian when Andrew went for a smoke, if I give a definition of something, he doesn't agree with it. He can provide his own, but instead he wants to play a semantic definition game and it's [ __ ] So, I don't like playing that game with him. I'm not. It's It's really funny because I can be super pedantic with semantics. That's true. But in this case, you by your own admission said it's my own definition, meaning it's proprietary. I have every business in the world exploring that to make sure that it is pointing at the thing that we both understand it's trying to point to, but it's not. You keep it. The re see it's actually you playing semantic games because if you would narrow and hone on what the definition was we wouldn't have to waste so much [ __ ] time on it so I understood what it is you're trying to play. If you just were provide your definition and we could find a middle ground. We can also look forward to your position. I don't prove your position. Exactly. This is the debate club [ __ ] that I'm talking about. Yes. It's a debate. It's an ideological debate between world. It's a debate club. You're playing some for some [ __ ] stupid ass points. Destiny triangles. Destiny triangles. You're trying to play for some points that aren't real. All right. We have Chaw here. Thank you. Cha Ch XD donated $100. These secular idiots are driving more men to Red Pill than even the most prolific Red Pill podcasters. They offer you nothing, no duty, no prescriptions, no virtue. Just generate hell on earth. Just degeneracy. It's all they ever prescribe. So, as you mentioned that Myron Gaines is a degenerate and he's promoting stuff. So, what virtue is he promoting or what uh duty is he? At least Myin, when you sit down and talk to him about virtues and about Christian ethics and about duty, he'll at least concede on these grounds. You literally just said the whole [ __ ] world can can just go ahead and die off if that means women can't be lawyers. Like, you're in a [ __ ] different world of crazy. Okay. All right. Got iron. Thank you. Iron Manny donated $100. No names. way yell and trump parake pace p I can't with you you look defeated shoulders slumped gaze down to do beta way n British Spanish there all right uh we have Jim GMD gym thank you man appreciate it uh let's see here that's taken uh guys if you want we'll do a roast session after this donated $699 leave. I'll continue. He talked [ __ ] behind your back, Andrew. Like a woman. Please pick up the mic. What are you not shocked about? This kid behind a divorce. Did I talk [ __ ] behind his back, Brian? As a teenager, what did you say to you were here whenever I was talking to you? I mean, I came in and you were talking [ __ ] when I wasn't here. All Andrew does is blah blah blah blah. That's talking [ __ ] It's kind of like I don't remember. Yeah, that I mean, that's definitely Even when I was walking in, I heard you talk. Me and Brian were having a conversation about how you don't give a definition. And that's not talking [ __ ] bro. Wait, I didn't say that. No, I said we were talking about it. I That's what I was saying, bro. When Okay. Yeah, we were talking about it. So, he got to the whole first part of this debate. You go rewind it later and you need to. That was me on defense and I gave you every opportunity to examine my worldview. When we got to your positive claims, you refused to answer a single [ __ ] question. It was ridiculous. Question for both of you. Uh, there were a bunch more prompts. Would you guys do a round two? Yeah. Like a different day. Yeah, a different day. Just cuz uh you know, Andrew, he's been up for 24 hours. We've already done 3 hours. I get it. But if you're down to come back, we'd love Andrew, if you'd like to do it again, we can, you know, it was uh entertaining. I can't wait. I can't wait to hear more about how degeneracy is going to save society. I can't wait to hear uh let's define this and let's define that. Let's uh how do you define this and what I'm not going to provide my It's not the rules. I don't the rules. If you if you want to cross examine my provide your I asked you to provide a definition. You didn't do it. It's because it's your position. It doesn't matter. If we don't agree with I need to give you a definition for your [ __ ] position, dude. I gave you my definition and if you didn't agree with it, tell me yours. It's that simple. It's not It's not debate rules. I know. It's not the debate rules. We can't have a real conversation. It's illogical. It's not illogical. I have a If you don't agree with my position, tell me yours and maybe we can find a middle ground. But that's not how that's not how you debate. That's not how you talk. That's not how anybody debates. That's how a lot of people have conversations. Critique. Listen, even inside of conversations, all you're really doing is debating. It's just that you refuse to formalize it because you're terrified of where your [ __ ] thoughts lead. So, what you do instead is filibuster, refuse to answer questions, refuse to allow me to even even understand what it is that you're talking about with a proprietary definition. I also have seen enough of your debates that I know when you go down the the morality rabbit hole, what's your what morality do you do subscribe to? Oh, I'm Christian ethics. Oh, well, you don't have any kind of relevant, you know, is relevantism. It's the same [ __ ] you do every [ __ ] debate. So, I'm not doing it. I I literally told you I wasn't going to get into morality. But if we went down that hole, you can't help yourself. You can't help yourself. You do it every debate. But here's the No, I don't. Not only that, not only do I not, especially in political debates, there's never a reason to. In this case, we never really got into morality at all. just your prescriptions for society which were just like I know everybody can do whatever the [ __ ] they want on a bridge. You're gonna say it's moral relativism is No, it's just it's just Crowley. It's just do as thou wilt. It's the same [ __ ] we've been dealing with for 60 years. You're not helping nothing. Okay. All right. A few more chats coming through. We got Birdman. $69 TTS donated $69. Thank you. When you leave the debate, you're going to leave with your definition. So Andrew is working with your definition. You're playing the semantics game, not Andrew. Exactly. I'm trying to be clear so we're not playing semantics or equivocating. See, the biggest thing and like now the audience can see this firsthand why this becomes so frustrating for people like me is with equiv equivocation. They'll move between the like a tube of toothpaste. They don't want you to pin them down on the [ __ ] they actually believe. I said from the beginning that masculinity should not be rigid and I don't have a strict definition. So I can't pin down any beliefs. Don't pin it down. Share yours. Right. Share yours if you want my definition of masculinity. Sure. If you want to finally share it, let's go for it. So, my definition of masculinity and my definition of femininity are going to be tied to virtues. Okay. So, here's what I mean by this. If you have male virtue, right, and female virtue, all virtues are going to be united in in the way that men and women both need to have courage, for instance. Okay? But if it is the case that the effects on society when one gender specifically lacks whatever that virtue is over the other and the results are either more devastating or more positive that would be a masculine trait versus a feminine trait. Interesting. Say that one more time. So if let's you said courage is something that both masculine I don't want to answer anymore about this. I can't believe this. I can't [ __ ] believe that. I just gave you my definition. I just gave it to you. Why are you asking me more about it? It's because I don't understand. I don't Well, I didn't understand yours, but that Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not questioning it. No, I'm not. I'm not answering any more questions about my definition. That's fine. Go for it. Not answering anymore. I wasn't questioning your definition. I'm just trying to make sure it make sure I heard it right. You're trying to understand it. So, you're trying to understand it so that you I didn't ask you what's courage, did I? Yeah. No, but the thing is it's like you're asking me follow-up questions about the definition. Rightly so, because I didn't understand it, but you're you're saying what's good. I didn't ask you what courage was. I didn't ask you what courage. You didn't need to. You were trying to get an elaboration. You said that's interesting. Let's dive in on this a little more. Yeah. Look at that. It's almost like you want to hone in definitionally on my worldview, which is smart. The way I approach that is so different from the way you approach it. And you [ __ ] know it. It's a conversation. No, it's not the same [ __ ] Something dude had the best faith debate ever. You are not a good faith debater. All you had to do, you're not a good faith. All you had to do is you're not a good faith where you asked me the definition. I gave it to you. I would have continued. You are notoriously a bad faith. According to who? To everyone who's debated you. Somebody who's debated you. Someone who's not leftist. No. Anyone who's debated you. Anyone. Anyone. Who's that? Literally anyone. Who's anyone? I've never debated anybody. Tommy Lauren thinks you're a good faith debater. Tommy Lauren. Whatever the [ __ ] her name is. A leftist. Tommy Lauren. Tommy Lauren. Yeah. Leftist. She's not a leftist. Oh yeah, she is. Okay, here we go. Now she's a leftist. She's a progressive. Yeah. Yeah, sure. She's a progressive. Yeah, I called her out for being a feminist. She's still pissed about it to this day. No, because you're not a good faith debater. That's why. And did did she ever call me bad faith? You're not a good faith. Did she ever call me bad faith? I'm sure she thinks it. Did she ever call me that? I'm sure she thinks she made it up. She said she still pissed you. You just made it up. You just made it up. So you made it up. She's still pissed, right? She's still pissed. Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'm bad faith cuz she's pissed. Why would Why would she be pissed if it's not if it's debate in a debate? Debates cuz you called her a [ __ ] name. It's cuz you called her a [ __ ] name. You know what happens? So women can be lawyers. I want people to have agency. And if that costs humanity, then what? What's life worth living? Exactly. If either they could be lawyers or lawyers I said agency it's not that specific Andrew I said I said agency yeah because it it ties into agency right so then so what you're saying again they better be able to be lawyers you're stronging my argument my argument is anyone who has if you can't have agency in your life I don't care if humanity goes off the cliff that's what I'm saying okay how much agency I don't know oh agency though whatever that means a choice to equality basically equal opportunity that's what I'm saying but men don't have equality equality and abortion, you're fine with it. Equal opportunity. Yeah. Men don't have equality in abortion. You're fine with equal opportunity. I said, not equality. Yeah. Men don't have equal opportunity with abortion either. You're fine with it. Well, they're not the ones giving birth. So, of course, they don't have equality. If they are the ones who are on the If they want to give birth, if they want to give equal opportunity to give birth, then yeah, let's go for it. No. How about just equal opportunity to have a say in whether or not their kid is born or not, but it's not an equal opportunity for them because they can't provide. They can't. They don't need to to have the equal opportunity. God, they can't. That's what laws are. We can we can literally outlaw abortion tomorrow. So, you would rather there not be no world than an abortion outlawed? I didn't say that. Well, you're destroying agency and equity, right? Is that your position, though? No, my position is not because I I have But women won't have agency. That's not the same thing, man. Why? Same [ __ ] They won't have agency. They won't have agency. Not the same thing. If women can't have abortions, they don't have agency. Now, the agency that men have, that's what I'm saying. The agency that other people have, if you can't have that, then no, I don't think whatever. Like so like abortion, you can't have an abortion. No, I didn't say that. Yeah, but if you can't have an abortion, how's that not limiting agency? Because other if no one can have an abortion, then other no one can have an abortion. That's it. And if if men have a say and women have a say, then both of them have a say and that's it. No, my point is if a men have agency in one thing and women have the same opportunity to have the same agency, then they should like with a child being born. No, because men don't have agency around child birth at all. Yes, they should have it. No, they don't cuz they don't they don't get pregnant. They don't get pregnant. Yes, it's still their kid. Still their kid of it after it's done after it doesn't it doesn't matter. Okay. So then by that logic then if you were going to implant I don't know your egg and se your wife's egg and then your semen into another woman and she agreed to it and it gets 6 weeks down the road is she should she be able to abort that kid if she doesn't want to go through with the pregnancy. It sucks but yeah. Okay. No, I at least I'm consistent. Good lord. Let's finish the chats if we can. All right, we got Lulu Lulu here. Thank you, Lulu Lulu. Lulu donated $100. Dude, stop dismissing this debate club. You came on to a debate. We all expecting a debate. That's like going to a funeral, cracking jokes, or going to a party with bad vibes. A debate can be several things. It doesn't have to be this prescriptive rules that Andrew likes to play. Debate can be a back and forth. We got Lucas coming in here. We got Lucas coming in and we got Rachel Wilson in just a moment with the chat. If you want to get it in, we lowered it. We're doing a $69 TTS. Lucas donated $100. This is a roast session. Hey, soy boy exclamation mark. Do you really think you changed in a single mind today with a vapid pratt? Are you that out of touch? Men have categorically rejected your world view. Did you see the election for potus? Yeah, that's one election. But I you guys aren't aren't headed for more. It's fine. Did you vote Biden? Oh, we're not? Huh? I absolutely did. Did you see what happened with abortion? We're not heading for more, though. Did you see what's in the Supreme Court right now where they're about to maybe limit anchor babies? We're not heading for more, though. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see how long this lasts. Yeah, we'll see how long it [ __ ] lasts. All right. We got Jag here. Doesn't care about logic or the end of humanity. Uh, sick and demented human. Thank you, Jag 48, for the super chat. Appreciate it. Uh, and then we have Brian S. Riddle me this. If all I need to do is read a book to get better, what good are psychologists? Also, Soy Boy's month old channel is so informative about how bad the red pill is that he gives his guests the subject matter to discuss. I don't get that last part. You're you're In other words, you're feeding them answers and information is what he's saying. Oh. Uh now, I don't know if that's true or not, but that's what he's saying. He's not. Also, I want to address that. No, I don't think it's just the book. It's the same thing like with going to the gym that I liken it to if you go to the gym to work out your body. Um, you know, a protein shake helps. For example, like reading supplementary material, I think helps. Same way with uh therapy. If you're going to therapy to work on like the mental gym, books, uh, are supplements to that. That's how I feel. All right. Uh, we'll do closing statements after we get through the rest of these chats. There's about five. Does this guy realize that there's cause and effect? There's a reason for the red pill. It's not all on men. We didn't cause it alone, so we can't fix it alone. What responsibility do women have? Well, I got his official answer for that on page. You don't have my official answer. You said none. No, he he responsibility I think to the red pill. That's duty. You said to the red pill. I'm talking about if we're trying to fix this divide. That's what he's talking about. So, I'm saying if the red pill Yes, I agree. It is a cause and effect. Men have been rejected. they're angry and red pill is is a community that they feel they can confide in. I think what needs to happen is I also think a lot of misandry is also a a reaction to the red pill that we're seeing more uh more prominent and I think that's a problem too. Um so I think if we want to get people back together we have to stop being so extreme and I think we have to stop demonizing each other and I think that's both men and women. Erroneous. Erroneous. Which part's erroneous? Mis misandry being a response to red pill to misogyny. Wouldn't wait what? I think red pill is a very misogyny space. You said that misogyny was the response. And so then if Miss Andre's response to the misogyny, then that would mean that it was Miss Andrew that caused the misogyny. How does that work? Well, because what caused the misogyny? Rejection. Rejection and men being men being demonized. That's not I didn't I said if I said the misandry now they need to stop demonizing. I don't think that was the reason misogynist content started coming up. Misogynist it started coming up because men felt rejected and they and and these guys pray on that rejection by saying victimized. No, I'm I'm in the middle of speaking. So these people are they're praying they're praying they're praying on people that are are rejected and angry. They're praying on people that are rejected and angry. And so they're saying, "Hey, I can help you self-improve." And by the way, women suck, don't they? That's what Red Pill does. Okay. Rachel Wilson donated $69. Male feminism is a mating strategy for beta males. They try to blend in with the women and seem non-threatening. If this guy really respected women, he would respect me and not lie about my husband. I don't think I disrespected her in any way. Okay. No, he said she's saying that the disrespect is when you lie about me. I don't think I lied about you either. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, when you say bad faith, those are all lies. You're a bad faith. debate. No, you just don't know how to debate. You're a bad faith debate. You not knowing how to debate doesn't mean I'm bad faith. The people who do know how to debate, they'll call you a bad faith debate. Which ones? Oh, not the liberal ones. Yeah. So, the conservative ones who all become my friends after and come to me for debate lessons. They don't think I'm bad faith, though. Huh. Just the ones who hate my political ideology. That's awful [ __ ] convenient. It's awful convenient that. And by the way, I've seen this on the other side, too. Tons of right-wing people are like, "Destiny's bad faith." I remember him putting out a post saying, "At this point, I reject bad faith because it just means you lost the debate." And you know what? I tend to [ __ ] agree with him on that. Well, that's good that you and Destiny agree on something. God b Lucas donated $69. Thank you, Lucas. Just imagine having to rely on this eel cast to storm the beaches of Normandy.

What about paternal abortion? My wallet, my choice. Are you okay with that? I believe that if a father has a child, they should take care of it. That's what I believe. What if they just give sperm? If that's a contractual agreement, then fine. Then what if they have a contractual agreement with the woman before they That's okay. So, so then if it is the case that men began to have women sign contracts that if they got pregnant, the men bore no responsibility. If Hang on, hang on. I just want let me finish the question. Okay. Right. That men bore no responsibility whatsoever and they signed it. You would want the state to not be to to enforce that, right? Yeah. If it's a if it's a contract between two people and that's what they agreed to, that's fine. Then welcome to the red pill. That's not it. Okay. Certainly not red pill. Yeah, that's a very red pill position. donated $69. Thank you, Spyro. This joker wants to help men with depression. Also, he says they have no agency over their kids and removes agency from involuntary celibates who definitionally can't do [ __ ] about their inalness. H Spyro, thank you for that. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Then we have this chat. Then we're going to do closing statements. Powered by Assist donated $100. Romania and Poland. We are the front line against Russian influence. For the love of God, vote wisely in the coming presidential election. Vote Nick Zadan and against Russian propaganda and ideology. Well, you can't be Poland or Polish. There's no way you could have written that. All right. So, here's what we're going to do. We're going to do closing statement. You're going to go first with your closing statement. Andrew, you have final word. My closing statement is simple. If the red pill is working for you, by all means continue consuming the content. But if it's not, I implore you to seek other alternatives. If you are depressed, um if you're lonely, um I encourage you to seek help. Um because a lot of the people in this community are struggling and I hate to see it. And the people I talk to that are in this community that say, you know, you're giving me hope for the first time. That's all I'm trying to do. And maybe I didn't make the best argument because I'm not a debater. I came here with a specific purpose and it's to try to help men in the red pill. And if I did, great. If I didn't, oh well, so be it. I gave it a shot. All right, Andrew. Uh, go ahead with your closing statement. Well, all it all just comes down to ignorance. So, the the ideas just haven't been thought through by my opponent. I don't think he's a bad person ultimately, though he does really advocate for a lot of degeneracy. Um, but what is what's new? What's he bringing you that's new? Like what what is he saying to you? He's saying what um basically the only things I could really get out of him was switch up your preferences. And I don't really have a good definition of masculinity or a good definition of femininity. I don't have anything that's rigid. That sounds basically like gender abolition essentially. That's what it sounded like to me. Okay, he's shaking his head. So yeah, probably something akin to that. This is all just progressive ideology repackaged. I actually care about incelss. I actually care about [ __ ] uh people, you know, men. I actually They don't give a [ __ ] Here's the thing, right? It all comes down to this. The truth is is that you, all of you in this audience are a threat to progressive ideology. And so they're going to tell you that the people who are the closest to your ideology, who represent your worldview, uh are the bad guys and the enemy and this and that. And then when they give you the prescriptions, what do they give you? [ __ ] nothing. What are the alternatives? He said, "I don't know. What should we do? I don't know what's masculinity. I don't know what's feminine. I don't know. Right? If I try to get a definition out of him, I'm being bad faith. If I debate too good, I'm bad faith. If I do any of these things, I'm bad faith. If if I even want to finish a sentence, I'm bad faith. All of this just leads me to this. It comes from a state of ignorance. And he doesn't realize he's prescribing the same [ __ ] that got us here to begin with. If we go back and we see the what does he say? He says the same thing feminists say to me all the time, right? He wants to take us back to the 1950s. And if you ask him like, okay, well, actually, let's just say I was. What's so bad about the 1950s anyway? Well, I don't know, you know, I don't know anything. I just I'm I don't know anything. I'm not really here to prescribe anything. I just [ __ ] don't know nothing. And it's like, well, okay, that's fine. But the difference between this guy and Destiny is well, the thank god for him. He doesn't I hope I don't think you don't let you're not in an open relationship, right? Okay. Good. Good. The difference between him and Destiny is like, yeah, maybe he doesn't let people plow his wife, but his prescriptions for things like this are just unfettered degeneracy. It's like do what do whatever you want. It's the Crowley and do as thou wilt. There is no duties. There is no virtues, right? All these things are very fluid. And then and then we just end up with well just kind of do what works. And it's like well then if that's the case the then even if this didn't work, what alternative would work? I don't know. So the whole thing is incoherence. nonsense. It's not that I don't like this guy. It's just that like it's very frustrating for me because I'm literally here to oppose this very ideology. And I don't even get the benefit of having him [ __ ] even tell me what it is cuz he doesn't know. And so it's like it's sitting there squeezing a tube of toothpaste, it moves there. Then he pin it down, it moves here. And so it's like, can I even match my worldview for prescriptions against his? I can't because I'm willing to give them and he's not. And that's it. Can I add one more thing? You can't add it after close, dude. If Andrew is willing to grant it otherwise, it's it's kind of in your benefit. I think I'm I'm trying to like So maybe I don't have the exact thing that I can prescribe to get out of the red pill. But if it is Christianity, if it is that kind of community, then I implore you to do that, you know, like that's totally fine. Oh, yeah. Well, let me ask this last question then since since I get the last word on this one. Yeah. What if it's the case that Christianity was 10 times more oppressive towards women than anything the red pill wanted to do? But it made men feel a lot better. Would you prescribe it then? Probably not. Yeah, I didn't think so. So, yeah, he's right. Come over to Christianity, especially based based as traditional Christianity, they are way worse when it comes to the question of egalitarianism than any of the [ __ ] Red Pillars could ever dream of. And he hates it. And he should. So, uh, before you leave here right now, Andrew, really quick, here's what we'll do. Um, so it sounds like you're both open to doing a round two. Uh, so we'll maybe schedule that for a future date. And also, Andrew is going to take off, but guys, if you want to stay tuned for a little bit, Raphael is going to stick around for a little bit and we're going to do a little roast session. And if any of you have any questions for Raphael, you're welcome to uh stay tuned. But Andrew needs to get some some Z's. He needs some Z's. I am sorry. I am sorry. Unless you want a burger. I can get you. I'm always I'm always a good sport. I always stay for for all these shows and stuff, but I'm just so [ __ ] tired today because of all this travel. But I will see you tomorrow refreshed, right? And Brian doesn't know it yet, but he needs me at my at my best. This is No, we do need Andrew fresh. And speaking of which, final thing here before Andrew leaves. We have Andrew for a debate tomorrow. On Friday, we have him for a debate on Saturday. We're doing a dating talk panel Sunday. We have a debate on Monday and then we have a special show Tuesday on Tuesday. So, this is a long week. So, I know maybe you guys would have liked to have seen this go a bit longer, but you know, we got to recuperate a bit. So, uh Andrew, thank you so much for coming. And for those of you who who might be listening, you're like, you know, [ __ ] Andrew is being a wuss. Look, I literally I didn't sleep. I haven't slept for basically 24 hours. I got off a plane and came right here to do this debate. So, like a little mercy from the chat. I know that all of them are going to spam L's anyway, and I deserve it, but little mercy. You know what though? If M for mercy, if you guys keep the roast going for about 7 8 hours, once Andrew wakes up and if we're still going, that's probably not going to happen. But, uh, Andrew, thank you for coming. We're going to continue the roast session. Always pleasure to have you. Uh, see you next time. Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, you know, we need to put I feel like we need something there. But anyways, um I'm going to let some of the there's more chats coming through. I'm going to let them come through. Uh let's see here, Raphael. Let's see what the viewers are saying. One sec, guys. It's taking me a sec to uh get it pulled up here. We have a question from the Glockavius. He says, "This [Music] Glavius donated $69. Is it straight to date a transgender woman? Would you date a transgender woman? That uh that's for you. I personally wouldn't and I I don't know. I think it's maybe it's it's in the queer territory. I have no idea. I don't know how to define it. Is it straight though? Uh I don't know. I don't know if how to I don't know if I'd be able to define that. No. Andrew, grab one of those beers on your way out by the way. One of the beers from the refrigerator if you'd like. Okay. Thank you, Glavius, for that. Uh we have this. He has a follow-up question for you. Gloavius donated $69. Do you think black people can be racist towards white people? Do you think women can be sexist towards men? If not, define racism and sexism. Um, no. Because I think racism and sexism often involves prejudice plus power. So, if you're, let's say, I'm going to make an example, and this is a wild example, but let's say you're afraid of a certain minority group. you don't want to walk on the same side of the street as them. I consider that prejudice. But if that same person comes in for a job at your company and you say, "No, I'm not going to hire you because of this." That's what I consider racist. So, it's similar with sexism as well. Same for both. Same for both. Prejudice power. Prejudice plus power for their identity. Okay. All right. That's from Glactavius. Um, well, if not Oh, well, you did define it then. You did define racism as sexism. Prejudice plus power. Is there any scenario in which a woman could be sexist towards a man? Uh, if she's empowered to do so, yes. Okay. So, she owns a company and she refused to hire men. That would be sexist. Okay. All right. Uh, there's some consistency there. Then we have Arch Duke France. Archduke France Fartinand $69. A female politician said, "Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their sons in combat." Do you agree that women are the primary victims of war? I mean, I think most men die in war, so I I don't see how they're the primary victims, but I do think war has casualties for each gender, for sure. So, would you say men are the primary victims of war? I think so. I mean, do people say otherwise? Uh, well, so that quote's actually from uh Hillary Clinton. Oh, she said that [ __ ] in the 90s and she actually repeated it again a like a year or two ago in relation to the Ukraine war. Um, women have always been the primary victims of war. That's what she said. Would you agree with Do you agree with her or disagree? I don't think I agree with that, but I haven't put any more thought into it. But I just feel like if men are the mass casualties of war, then they're probably the biggest victim, I would imagine. Just from a quick thought. We got more chats coming through. Really quick though before we do that, uh guys, Venmo, Cash App, whatever pot if you want 100% of your contribution to go towards the show, like the video, please. Also, mayor, if you could pull up Twitch, guys, go to twitch.tv/ whatever on your way out if you're if you're leaving the stream. Uh, you know, maybe me and Raphael are going to get into a little debate here. Who knows? Uh, I'd love that. Drop us a follow and a prime sub on. Guys, it's been 46 minutes. I think it's bugged, boys. I think it's bugged. Twitch pro uh the Twitch subs are bugged. Can somebody check if there's a little Twitch Prime in the chat? DreamBanger TV. Thank for the Prime though. Drop us a follow in the Prime sub over there on Twitch. Would really appreciate it. Also, discord.gg shop.weather.com. We're doing a $69 roast session. Get it in. If you want to roast, you can roast me. It's really cheap, guys. Roast Raphael. Roast. Roast Raphael. Maybe roast him a little bit. Boy, better cook. Let's go. You roast him. Roast him. All right. We have tone police patriarchy. Here we go. Thank you for this. Oh, thank you for that. Tone police patriarchy donated $69. Reformed feminist here. Red pill saved me. Feminist ideology brought several of my peers to take matters into their own hands. Your view of red pill is incorrect. Dig deeper, please. Great show, gentlemen. Thank you, Tone. Police patriarchy. That's interesting. I mean, look, if whatever ideology is driving you to be depressed, lonely, isolated, um, angry, you know, I would prescribe you get away from it. If, you know, I don't know, I I just know the statistics and the peer-reviewed studies say that red pill, uh, you know, content um, creators kind of create that in their audience. And, um, that's what every study kind of says. So, and I think this loneliness epidemic is only going to lead to more men unalivives. And that's what I don't want because I know what it's like to feel depressed. I know what it's like to feel like you don't want to keep going. And so I want to help people um find a way out of that. Do you think uh do you think that feminism is sort of is similar to red pill or do you think they're different in in the there's a difference of advocacy of what they're talking about, but you think it's like the counter image? No, I think Missandry is probably the closest thing to what red pill is because I don't think there's necessarily an equivalent for women on that side. But I do think that my personal definition of feminism and I think a lot of people's today is just equal opportunity regardless of outcome. Um so that's what I view as feminism. Equal opportunity. Would you be in favor of uh the draft, military draft for women? Um I don't consider that equal opportunity. What What do you mean? Um, for example, an opportunity would be um, well, yeah, I I ag Well, I don't think the draft is an opportunity for men or women. Agreed. Agreed. So, I'm not really talking about equality of opportunity, but it would be equality if both men and women were subject to, but I'm not I'm not pushing for necessarily full equality. I'm pushing for equal because that's not my definition. My definition is equal opportunity. If a man has the opportunity to do something and a woman is just as capable of doing said thing, then do it. Now, in in my definition, if you're talking about conscription, if a woman is as capable of a soldier as somebody else and the country decides that's what that's, you know, that's what we should go, then go for it. But I don't think we should just start drafting anybody. I think it is about And also, for the record, do you know how many what percentage of men were drafted for Vietnam? Uh, I think wasn't it like a couple hundred thousand? No, but what percentage of the male population at the time? It's like 2%. So, it's not that big of a thing. And in the 20th century, only Hold on. It's not that big. I thought your whole thing here though was like I want to reduce the unaliviving rate of men. I want to reduce let's get rid of conscription. Right. But you're saying it's not that big of a thing. I think the Vietnam veterans who were drafted who either are still alive who have PTSD or depression or who are homeless, whatever it is, or the ones who are dead probably disagree with you that it's a small thing. No, you're right. That I shouldn't have said it like that. I'm saying it's a small percentage of the population that it's not happening to the vast majority of men. So, I think the vast majority of men aren't ever going to be drafted. It's never going to be a thing. Simply because in the 20th century, only 9% of the total male population has been drafted. So, that's still more than I'd like. Wait, in the in in the 20th century, only 9% of the male population has ever been drafted in US. That's a lot of men. I agree, but it's not the majority. And it's not the vast majority. It's not even close. Well, all men have to register for the selected service. Agreed. So, there's inequalities. While I agree with you that there might we might be in peace time or there might be periods of peace time where there's men aren't going to be drafted, there are still ramifications for not registering for the selective service. Sure. And all men have to register for the selective service. One of the big things we were talking about was voting. In order to be eligible to vote as a man, you have to register for the selective service. Failure to do so precludes you from the ability to vote. Sure. I don't necessarily see that as an opportunity. I see that as something I wish I'm just talking about equality in general, not but I'm not I'm not really prescribing equality across the board. I I'm saying equal opportunity. So if a man is able to make a decision in his own life to do something and a woman is just as capable of doing the same thing, she should do it, too. I'll engage with you on equality of opportunity. Women have the opportunity to not be subject to the to selective service and force military conscription. Seems like an opportunity, right? But so are you in favor of just abolishing the draft entirely? Ideally, yes. Okay. But do you think that that's uh politically tenable? I think so. I think we have a large enough volunteer army. And I also think uh wars in the future aren't going to be necessarily boots on the ground. I think wars in in the future are going to be either cyber or they're going to be drones or they're going to be we have air superiority. I don't think it's going to be boots on the ground unless something crazy happens. I mean, let's talk about the most the two most modern conflicts. So, you have the war in the Middle East and then you have the Ukraine war. Are there not boots on the ground? Are men not being drafted into these conflicts? Sure, but they're not being drafted. There wasn't a draft in in Iraq. There wasn't a draft in Afghanistan. These Well, I'm talking about Ukraine and and I'm talking about the United States. Oh, you're talking about the United States? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. There hasn't been a draft since Vietnam, right? But in Ukraine, there there is forced military conscription and they abduct men into the in the streets. I don't agree to that. I mean, maybe if it's like things are so dire, that's what we have to do. I mean, I I hope we never get to that point, but in an ideal world, we have a large enough in the US, we have a large enough volunteer army, and we have technological um advancements that are are superior to our adversaries. So, um I don't think it's going to be a boots on the ground war unless something crazy happens to the world. Yeah. But so given so I mean we can talk about should the draft go away but since it is a reality the draft is a reality or selective service is a reality. Should shouldn't women be obligated to uh sign up as well? I don't think so. No. Why? Um I think because men are more capable in war. That's why. And I think that's what you'd rather have. Yeah. But I mean for So I I saw a stat and I maybe somebody in the military in the chat can weigh in. In order to field one combat soldier, you need 10 uh support roles in the military. Yeah. So if you want like frontline combat soldier, you need 10 people uh in support roles, administration to enable that uh one individual on the front line. So there are roles that women could serve in the even look, even if women were subject to force military conscription, it's probably unlikely that they would encounter uh frontline combat. I personally think that's still unequal. I guess I would accept that they should at least be subject to force military conscription, but there's plenty of roles in the military that women can, you know, the the pencil pushers. Pencil pushers. Well, here's what I'll say. I think men should still be the primary people that have to serve. I mean, again, I I if I could get rid of, you know, the draft, I would if we have just a volunteer army and technological advancements to to combat our enemies. But should a draft, if something terrible happens and we have to draft, I still think primarily let's draft men because they're more capable at combat and in the front lines. But if we desperately need the help and women can be in the support role, then you know, maybe that's a discussion to have. Honestly, I think we should just draft women for frontline combat. I don't think that's a good idea. That That's kind of sexist of you. I don't think I'm I don't think I'm preventing this. No, you don't believe in strong independent boss babes. I do. And if there are women in my in my definition of feminism, if there are women who would like to go to the front lines because they feel capable enough, then go for it. But I'm not saying they should be forced to. I think I honestly we draft them. It's kind of like, you know, we've had hundreds hundreds thousands of years of forced military conscription for men. Maybe just like test it out for like a century. Just send the women to war. You're not serious though, right? And we should teleise it. This isn't for you're not for real, right? This isn't for real. I mean, look, if this this idea that men are better suited for for war. Yeah. Yeah, you're you're right. But what if everybody just we all agreed and let's just let the women do a bit of the fighting for a century. It's just women versus women. So, it's kind of, you know, Oh, I see what you're saying. It's not women across the board. Like I think equal for the equality of opportunity, we should allow women to have post-traumatic stress disorder and you know just like get a get a artillery shell in the in the the gullet. I'm in favor. What would the men be doing? We would be uh what what are the women doing in Ukraine? We'd be on Tinder sleeping with the the women who didn't get drafted. We would uh we would be kicking it. We'd be kicking it. we'd be uh mowing lawns and [ __ ] And I mean, that is an interesting hypothetical, but um you're not for it, you know? I'm not I'm not because again, my loose definition of masculinity is doing the right thing because it's the right thing. And I think men Yeah. What's the right thing? The right thing in this situation is protect women. That's what I feel like. Protect women. Yes. I I think the right thing would be in the event of a war, all the countries just agree. All countries agree. Okay, we're just going to have women, you know, we're all feminists now. We're going to have the women fight. Just test it out. And then, but we get to televise it, too. I mean, we already do that with the war. I I just don't think that's necessarily feminism. I mean, here's a loose example. The women get to fight. No, it's an equal opportunity. It's not It's an equal opportunity to die. That's not an opportunity that No one thinks being the front line is an opportunity opportunity for women to die. No, I certainly don't. That is misogynistic, sir. I want you to apologize to all the women watching that you don't want equal opportunity for women to die. So, the way I see it, and this is a stupid example, but it's the first one I that came to mind. If you're on an airplane and you see someone struggling to put their their suitcase up, do you get up and do it? If if I see somebody struggling on in the carry-on, what what I don't I'm just asking when you're on an airplane, do you and you see someone struggling? I'm not even I'm not even saying anybody. I'm not even saying a gender. I'm not saying anything. If someone is struggling, sure, I'll help. That's kind of how I feel masculinity is. I'm capable enough to do this thing. I should do it. That's how I feel. I think we should help women get drafted into the military and let them do a bit of the dying. I don't believe you. I think they should I think the women should do a bit of Trump hands. Are these your Trump hands? Okay. I think we should have some of the women do a bit of the dying just to equal it out a little bit. you know, a little bit of shell shock, little, you know, a little bit of uh mortars. Let them experience some mortars. Trench warfare. Trench warfare is back in Ukraine. They got trenches. You see the drones dropping the the grenades. You seen that? Yeah. Let's maybe look equal. Uh let's get women to do it. I I I don't I don't agree. I don't agree. Deb, I'm the real I'm the actual real feminist here. You you seem like a bit of a red pill podcast, bro, with your, you know, men are supposed to men are supposed to protect women. That's very, you know, that's I think I think men should protect the innocent and I think men should protect people that can't protect themselves. That's what I believe. When So, the women are the innocent and the men are what? The devils. No, if what are the men? I'm not saying men are I'm not giving a judgment on men. I'm not giving a judgment on anybody necessarily, but if somebody can't defend themselves, I think men should. That's all. Men men should. Yeah. No, but that's why I'm saying with the war, we just make that [ __ ] all women. We have a United Nations. We have them agree. Okay. For the next hundred years, all the men, you know, they're not going to fight. We're going to send the women to fight. I think that you're not on board with that. Do you get on board with that? Do you think that would be You're not on board with that? I'm not. Do you think that would be good for the general population and in terms of us, you know, continuing our population? Do you think that would be a good thing? Yeah, it'd be good. Okay. It'd be good. Okay. Yeah. You know, you send you send the feminists to fight. Send the feminists to fight or send the anti-natalist cuz like look, if if you're a woman and you're pregnant, you can you can get out of it. But don't you want women to be getting pregnant during this time? Look, we're going to put a cap. Only 10% only 10% of the women can fight. That's it. We won't send more. Just 10%. That's it. That's a weird rule when you're having a war where you're like, "Hey, we're only going to send 10% of our troops. You guys agree to that?" I don't I just don't think that works. I mean, again, I don't think anyone would. Well, 10% of the population in this hypothetical, 10% of the population. So, uh, just why? But don't you think we should send women I don't war? Why not? I don't I just don't because I don't think they think they're capable. I I think men are more capable in war. Men are more capable in war. Okay. All right. We got some chats coming through, but I got some more I got some more things I want to talk to you about. Okay. All right. Let me let some of the chats through. Sorry for the delay, guys, but I'm sitting next to a misogynist who doesn't want women drafted, and it's really frustrating. I'm really upset by this whole, you know, this the sexism is just I feel the sexism coming from you, man. It's a little It's a little upsetting to me, but okay. I'm really clothing. It's really donated $69, dude. With the exception of you soy boy libs as your target audience, you have absolutely not a chance in hell in changing any man's mind. Red pill plus Christian ethics equals society's salvation. I already have changed people's minds, but that's okay. You know what? Oh, wait. Never mind. Okay. Selena Gour donated $69. The red bill is the alternative. It's the rejection of do what you want all the time and that is what isn't working. Have standards. Hold men and women to those standards. Seek Christ. Are you are you a religious man? Are you uh I was raised Catholic but no. You're agnostic. You're a I call it agnostic. Agnostic. Okay. Jason Castle donated $69. Feminist man. I will literally fight you. Brian set up this fight. Oh my god. Andrew. This is why I don't consider myself a good debater because I would have fought this dummy. Make a class on how to be patient. Wow. I don't know, Jason. I got some hands, dude. I don't know. Were Were you getting angry at Andrew during There was a moment there where you told him to shut the [ __ ] up and I thought you were about to get up. No. And throw some hands. No, it's Andrew yells that all the time. I'm just giving him his own medicine. You gave him a taste. Okay, that's it. I'm I was pretty calm through the whole thing. All right. Uh, look, we got another chat coming in. Nameless. Thank you for it. Nameless name seven donated $69. Yo, Rafa, you seem like a decent person, but you need to think for yourself and stop letting the world shape your opinions. You say you want people to leave Red Pill, but you also prescribe it. I don't see how I prescribed it beyond saying, "Hey, if it's working for you, if you're living a happy life, if you're getting what you want out of relationships and friendships, okay, I'm not going to tell you to change. But if you're not, I'm prescribing you consider alternatives. That's all I'm saying. You know, this is what I think is going to happen. You do that second debate with Andrew. I think you might become red pill." It's not going to happen. I think it could happen. I love my life too much. I just don't know why I would switch. My life is great. I live in Orange County. Your life would be even better. It can't be. It might be better. I live in Orange County. I have two great dogs. I have a wonderful wife. I'm happy with my life. I don't know. I don't know why I would need anything else. Wait, how how old are you, by the way? Just uh I turned 41 in August. 41. Okay. And uh you don't want kids. Is that correct? That's correct. And And how old does your wife feel my music? Um she's 30. She'll be 38. Okay. And did you like when you started dating her, did you know going in like or maybe both of you had a conversation you don't want kids? Yeah, it we started that early. Yeah, we started that conversation early. But how are you going to build more blue pill that you said your blue pill, right? How are you going to have more blue? You got to because if if you know the Christians are are out, you know, having more kids. Well, here's what I'll say to that. I don't think necessarily. The dogs can't be blue pill. Dogs are red pill. Honestly, my dogs are red pill, dude. My dogs are My dogs are Trumpers. It's really What breed? What breed? Uh, I got a lab mix and a lab. Red pill, dude. They're super mad. What's the other one? Uh, he's like a a hound mix. A hound? Oh, that's very red pill. Red pill. They're very red pill. They knew they told me when I came here I was going to lose it to Andrew. Yeah, dude. It's really [ __ ] up. You speak to dogs. I speak to dogs. That's part of the blue pill. But um one of the things that uh I'll say oh wait you had something serious a second ago. Oh about having kids. I I don't necessarily think and I think a lot of parents would agree that just because you have a kid doesn't mean the kid is going to follow your worldview. A lot of kids are born into religious families and then they end up being atheists. So I think you can't say I'm going to make more people cuz they're going to follow my ideology. I want to take care of the people that exist today and have them consider a different ideology. That's why you gota you can't let them have a smartphone until they're 18. Hey, look. I think that Hey, I didn't have a smartphone till I was 18 and I stopped being Catholic. So, yeah. That's not cuz smartones weren't around, you know, at the time. But, uh, and I got to say, look, I I got a flip phone when I was in high school. Nice. And, uh, so you were rich. I Oh, yeah. Just piles of money with my little shitty Samsung or whatever it was. I'm just kidding, man. Um, but uh, you know, I I kind of feel bad for the kids today. Like at 10 years old, you got you got access. I agree. Great. Well, you know what though? I had the internet. I had the internet, but the internet back then wasn't what it is today. In the 2000s, the internet there was some crazy [ __ ] Yeah. I mean, the thing is even like to get a little more serious, but like the people that are finding Red Pill, it's because the YouTube algorithm is often recommending it to people. It just kind of like happens. They just like go on YouTube and all of a sudden now they're redpilled. Yeah. You know the thing is though is like feminism is mainstreamed. That [ __ ] is forced down your [ __ ] throat. And I'll tell you this. I'll tell you this, Raphael. Let me tell you about the feminism. Okay, here's the thing about the feminism. You got the university, you got colleges, every single university college in this country. Let me tell you, every single one has a woman's studies, a feminist studies, a gender, a gender studies program. I'm telling you, it's indoctrination. the feminism mind virus indoctrinated into these women into these men. Did you take a feminism You went to college, right? You got a you got a bachelor's of arts of advertising. Did you take a feminism class in college? You took feminism, did you? Tell us the truth. You took feminism class. I think you did. No. And I don't remember being indoctrinated to anything in college. In fact, I went to college in the panhandle of Florida, which is very [ __ ] red. No, that's base. And I don't remember having any. How did you turn out like this? Well, I thought for myself as as your as your guy from [ __ ] Florida and you became a feminist. What the [ __ ] And it was a It wasn't Florida right now. It was Florida 20 [ __ ] years ago. Exactly. Yeah. And I'm telling you, like the guy said, I just learned a thing for myself. Am I being cringe or is it kind of funny? I think it's kind of funny. It's kind of funny. All right. All right. We got more chats coming through. More chats. All right. None. Thank you very much. Nonated $69. Thank you. Depressed and angry people search out RP who can be bitter and hateful. Ellie, long-term RP is amazing for men. It pushes to get a great vetted partner. Go to the gym, get a job, and get a social life. Hey, Anan, if that's what you're getting out of it, that's great. I mean, I think going to the gym is great. Taking care of your body is great. I think having a great social life is great. I think picking a good partner is great. Josh Brooks donated 69 coming in here. Thank you. So, don't think it's a good idea for women to be in combat, but are okay with them going if they want. What would it look like to you if it was 50/50 women to men boots on ground? Describe that plaza. What would it look like? I mean, it would look like 50/50. I don't know. I don't know what it would look like. I mean, ideally, men would probably be more in the combat roles. Um, because I again, I think they're more capable in that scenario. Um, but if some terrible thing happens and women have to go too, well then I hope they're supportive. That's that's kind of how I see it. I You know what? So, okay. When it comes to duties though, so men, we were talking about the draft earlier. Yeah. And this, you would agree is a duty that men have that women don't. Which part? A conscription. Yeah. Conscription. Uh at at most 10% of men have that duty. Yes. Well, all men are uh are subject to the potentiality That's correct. Of the draft. That's correct. I agree with you. Not all men will be drafted. Most men won't be drafted ever. Uh but they do still have to register for the selective service. If they don't, there's certain uh there it's technically a felony. There's a fine. You can't uh reg you can't get certain federal student student loans. There's certain federal jobs that you're barred from if you fail to register. And uh I think there's maybe one or two other things that are evading me right now. But um I'm just I'm curious though what like what duty do women have to to either men or to society? I I just don't necessarily prescribe duty if I'm legally obligated a duty that's different than what I think is just an inherent duty. Something that you're just coming to this world without anyone asking if you want to be here and being prescribed duties out the off the gate. I don't necessarily think I I don't believe that if there are duties. Do you not believe that? I don't believe that you inherently have duties just because you're born. But I mean, so every single male in the United States once they turn 18 have to register for the selective service. And an entailment of that is in the event of some wartime conflict where a draft where there is a draft someone could be forced to go and die. go and die or serve in the military. That's a duty. What that's that's a exclusively male duty. What duties do women have? But it's through the legal system. If the legal system changed that, then it wouldn't be a duty anymore. So yeah, sure. I agree. So if we didn't have that anymore, it would no longer be a duty. And I don't necessarily think men have a duty outside of anything legal. If my personal worldview is that men should help whoever they can because they're capable of it. Whoever is the most capable should help. That's what I feel. No. Like, do men have a duty to protect women? No. If a guy decides he doesn't want men don't have a duty to protect I don't necessarily think everyone has that duty. I think men I think men who subscribe to my version of masculinity, they would feel that need, but not everybody would. Do you think men should protect women? In my in an ideal world, yes. But I'm not going to say you must, you know, like I don't I don't believe I don't believe in must. Um, so I think it's the same thing with women cuz I know a lot of people say, "Well, if men have to do this thing, then women's duty should be birth because that's what they do." And I just don't think we should see women that way personally. I have a question for you. Um, when it when it does come to the draft, and I know it sounds like you would like to abolish the draft. Is that fair? Ideally, yeah. Okay. But given that governments and nations will not relinquish the ability uh or the right to force its citizenry uh into a military conflict if the government has deemed it necessary to do so. Uh again what would women's duty or what should women's duties be under the current system? I I don't have one. I don't I don't have any kind of prescription for that. Would you say this for example? So, uh, one of the arguments for why women aren't subject to military conscription is in the example of some catastrophic war, you ought to protect the women because they would be able to repopulate the the uh the the nation. They could repopulate the nation cuz, you know, you could have one man impregnate 100 women. Doesn't work the other way. Yeah, I've heard that. Um, but do you think for example, like let let me ask you this. Granting that a specific government is not going to get rid of the draft. Uh, you would agree that well, I mean, this might even be your own position. Let's say there's a a belligerent nation, and this is hypothetical. So, let's talk about the United States. Let's say uh China decides to invade us. And you know that the uh doctrine of the Chinese invading force or the government or whatever it is, uh they're going to if they successfully invade the United States, they're going to put all the men to the sword and they're going to take all the women as war brides and they're essentially going to essay all the women. Okay? And the as the the US military currently stands in this hypothetical with just the volunteer force, the volunteer force would not be capable of the military intelligence they do have. The military force would not be able to repel or defeat the invading Chinese army military. However, you know with certainty if you were to draft men that you would be able to repel the invading Chinese military force. Would you under this circumstance force men to fight if let's say you were the dictator of the United States? I think I would under my worldview because if I think the right thing to do is to try to protect the innocent even though innocent men are also involved in this. Um I think it's still the right thing to do and it sucks but I think that's kind of what I think right and I think perhaps the calculation here is you know that by forcing these men to go and fight you are sending men to go and die and men will go and die right innocent men but if you don't they're going to die anyways and all the women are going to get raped by the invading Chinese right my question to you now is this though is that in a similar scenario let's say We projected, we knew with certainty, I don't know, it's again hypothetical. In 20 years time, we knew that the Chinese were going to invade in 20 years, but we knew our our population wasn't large enough to fend off this invading force. And the only solution to this would be to have a draft for women to give birth to children immediately so that we would have the necessary and requisite population in 20 years time to fend off this coming invasion. Would you instill a uh birth draft? And to be clear, the women could pick their partners and have consensual sex, but the government would essentially say, "You must do this. You must have children. Otherwise, all the men are going to be put to the sword and you guys will all get great." I would not force it. If that was if women wanted and couples and husbands and wives wanted to volunteer for that, fine. But I would not make it a mandatory thing. Um but if you didn't make it a mandatory thing, the enough people that would want to do it. The entailment of it would be if not a women not enough women gave birth, there wouldn't be a substantial enough uh fighting age population in 20 years time. And so in this instance, uh even if you're forcing or if you don't force the women to give birth, then all the men get put to the sword and all the women get taken as war brides. Um I don't know. I I I have I have trouble with that. I It just doesn't sit right. It's very handmade still tail to me and that just seems completely dystopian. Um, so hypothetical. Yeah. I I don't think I I don't think that's something I would do if I was the leader of the country. I would either try to find another way. Um, but or try to encourage people to do it on their own without it being forced. I think those were would be my first two options. If push came to shove and it was they're going to die anyway, then maybe there's something. But it's just I would try to other options first. Do do you think uh giving birth is a is a uh when you otherwise wouldn't want to is like a bigger grievance than men dying? Um not necessarily a bigger grievance, but it is an undertaking that takes quite some time and it's beyond just pregnancy. It's also raising the children and feeding the children and doing all that. So, it's a longer engagement and men aren't guaranteed to die in the war. Some will. So, I think if you're guaranteeing women to be forced to have pregnancies, I think that's different than the potential to die. Sure. We got some chats coming through. We have, give me one sec, guys. Jason Cassell. Uh-oh. Jason Castle donated $69. You really are an idiot. Over 8% of men were drafted during Vietnam. Around 33% of men were drafted in the 20th century in the USA. It's not true. You are a fing idiot. It's not true. I'd like to see your numbers. What Jason's saying is not true or Yeah, it's Yeah, his numbers are too high. I don't know. I don't know if he he You know what he's looking at? I think he's looking at eligible 33%. Yeah. Yeah. 8% and 33%. He's looking at eligible men for the draft instead of just the total male population. Yeah. But I mean like men who are in their 60s wouldn't be drafted. Theoretically, we're all going to get to our 60s. So Jason Cassell, can you clarify? Are you talking cuz like the drafting age I think is between like 18 and 25 26 I think he's looking at eligible I'm talking about total male population people who have been drafted. Okay. Uh let's see here. We have uh Noodles. Thank you man. Appreciate it guys. $69 $69 $69 TTS forward to the upcoming content. Brian Raphael, why do you advocate for equal opportunity and not actual equality? I think RP is encouraged from this. Keep telling men life is tough though. Um I don't know if I'm saying men life is tough. I don't remember if I said that. But um I don't necess my version of feminism is not forcing outcomes. It's forcing uh or it's basically giving opportunity. So equality would be forcing outcomes and I don't believe that's what it is. I think everyone if they're capable should have the opportunity to do something. That is my version of it. I don't think forcing equality is what I'm advocating for. All right, guys. $69 TTS. We have a few more coming in. We have Lucas again. Thank you, Lucas. Appreciate it. Lucas donated $69. My man, and I use that term loosely, just defined feminism in a nutshell. Opportunity/s without reciprocal duties/obligations. thought men are more capable, therefore they should be happy to die. I mean, if the only prescription is that women's duties is that they should have children, I mean, I think that's lazy. I just think that's like, well, they should have kids. Like, no, I don't I don't believe that. Wait, you should you don't think women should have kids? As a duty? Oh, as a duty. Okay. Uh although shouldn't it I perhaps it's not a duty for all women, but like would you say maybe the majority of women should have children? I wouldn't I again I wouldn't say should I think the people who are deciding to have children today often are people who have made the calculated economic decision to do so and they are in a better position to be parent good parents in my opinion. So I think we're not necessarily looking for numbers and volume. I think we're looking for good parents and good families. I think that's the ideal not volume. We have Najib. Thank you for this donated $69. How do you define male privilege, women being oppressed, sexism or feminism if you don't believe in I have definitions for sex or gender? I would say male privilege is mostly because we have men have mostly been the people in power. So they um are less likely to have ever been oppressed. I mean I know men go through oppression um as well. But if you look at it from a perspective of women, they have been far more oppressed than men. Have they? Yes, I would make that case. How so? Because I believe oppression is the systematic denial of rights and resources. So, for example, women couldn't go to college, women couldn't vote, women couldn't own land, women couldn't have bank accounts. That's more oppressive to me because it's systematic. Let's talk about voting for just a sec. Uh what is the period of time, at least in the United States, that uh almost all or all men had the right to vote and women didn't? Uh I don't remember. I don't know. Yeah, I think it's uh if I I could be off by a couple years, but I believe it's 50 years. That's a period of time between when men all men or almost all men had the right to vote and all women had the right to vote. Before that, most men most women they they couldn't vote, right? You had a you had small groups of concentrated power. You had monarchies, very small people. Voting is a really super new past couple hundred years. you go back even 200 years, most men couldn't vote, most women couldn't vote. The way that men uh got the right to vote is because they had to go to war. Yeah. At a point in time. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like if you you if you look at so women got the right to vote in 1920, right? What happened just before then? World War I. World War I. And so it's interesting conveniently for for women and I suppose feminists that they got the right to vote uh right after the mo at least at the time. World War II had higher casualty count. Although you could argue that in many ways World War I was uh much more brutal in in in many ways the trench warfare and the soldiers were on the front for way longer than you know they'd be like in perpetuity on the front. Um whereas like in World War II they to they shift out and it was a bit different but it was World War II was also really of course um but the the most barbaric war that had ever been seen up until that point most casualties etc etc. Uh women conveniently secured the right to vote right after it because one of the concerns of the suffragettes was well if we secure the right to vote as women we're going to be subject to to military conscription. feminists were able to secure the right to vote without any corresponding responsibility. And that responsibility duty would be having to go to war. Sure. And so I mean and and again men got that because they had to basically be willing to die. Yeah. They had to be at one point it wasn't that. So some at one point it was also land ownership and things like that. There there were other differences too. But I mean this this idea though that that women that men for like millennia had like all men Mhm. I I will actually grant to you that like throughout most of human history the men which by the way was a very very small percentage like 0001% of men had power. The rest were like the peasant peasant the peasantry class oppression too you know right? But so like the top apex of men, yeah, they're the ones who did have power. Yeah. But like that doesn't speak to the 99.99% of men who were just as oppressed and who had Honestly, I would argue throughout history, at least my big argument here was is as it relates to warfare, women have often been shielded by the barbarity of war. Absolutely. Women have been shielded from having to participate. They're protected. Typically, at least, you know, your own civilization, your own population, your own nation, your own society, women are are protected. Yeah. Are protected. And so, I mean, no, I see what you're saying. I I I'm not denying that men have been oppressed. There's obviously been oppression of men as well. I think though, as time progressed, men got more and more privileges that women didn't. Same with minorities. You know, there was oppression with minorities as well. you know, slaves had to appeal to white men in order to get free. You know, there's been oppression of different classes, races, and and and things like that. And I and men obviously have been oppressed, too. Um, but I think as time has progressed, men had more and more agency, and women didn't. And I think even if you're talking about voting, let's let's take voting off the table, just being women being able to own land or women being able to have a certain job, those were, you know, taken from them. And that's why I define it as oppression. Now, voting, I think anyone should have the right to vote because it's their country. They have a right to say. I think if you're a disabled man, that doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to vote because you can't go to war. So, I I I think, you know, uh in terms of denying resources and rights, women, minorities have had it worse than, let's say, white men uh in general. Uh I mean, it's perhaps on that specific front. You said denial of resources and and rights. systematic denial of resources and rights. A systematic denial of resources and rights. Okay. So, and the examples you provided were what? Like land ownership? Land ownership. Uh certain jobs, going to school. Tell me what year do you think women were allowed to own property and land? Uh they weren't allowed to have, you know, debt and and bank accounts and things like that for a long time. So, they weren't owning land until I mean, as far as I'm aware, they weren't owning land for quite some time. Uh, women have always been able to own land. Okay, maybe that's a bad example. My my understanding of it is that when women were married, any property that she had became her essentially her husband's. That's my understanding of it. Oh, interesting. And if the marital couple, they owned land, it was like in his name. women in the 1800s in the United States, 1900s, they could own land. Maybe that's a bad example. Maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong about that. But for example, uh a father in his will could bequeath to say he only had daughters. If if if it was actually true that women could not own property or own land in the event that a father uh a father of only daughters and he has say three three or even one remaining heir uh one daughter two daughters three daughters where would the property go to? Probably the daughters. So they could own property and they could own theoretically but but I'm saying if a woman wanted it's not just theoretically in practice women owned land they could buy land. Okay like I said this is pro this might be a bad example but that doesn't mean women could have their own resources to purchase land. Maybe they inherited it or maybe it came through something else but women didn't weren't able to work in highpaying jobs for a lot highpaying jobs in this country for quite some time. Like I said, they couldn't practice medicine or finance or uh law 55 years ago. That's when someone 55 Hold on. It's in the 1970s. Hold on. You're saying there were no female lawyers prior to the 1970s? That's correct. I'm going to have to I need to fact check this. Uh when you're ser just to be clear, there were no no female lawyers. Women could not practice law until around the 1970s. When could women practice law? And this was hold on. So I'm and if you can correct me if I'm wrong. So the first formal admission of a woman to the bar was in 1869 with Arabella Mansfield's admission in Iowa. By 1879, federal law allowed qualified women to practice in any federal court and Belva Lockwood became the first woman admitted to the bar of the sup Supreme Court. You're like a century off 1870 1869. I'm telling you in large I'm telling you in large practice women couldn't practice law or men until 1970s. That's correct. Where's the evidence for this? I I looked it up. This claim is completely dubious. I looked it up, dude. So you're saying by law they were procluded, excuse me. Same way women were procluded from going to school. Same way women could go to school to college. Yes. Okay. I believe there are perhaps some private schools that uh didn't allow them in. I think that's I'm I'm not denying that there weren't specific schools that barred women from entry. But my understanding is in the starting in the 1800s, women had access to higher education. Let's say I'm wrong about all those things. Could women, let's say, could women have their own bank account? Could women have their own bank account? Uh, you tell me. I don't They couldn't. That was factually true. It's factually. I mean, look, I want to look at what you're looking at. Maybe my data was wrong. I doubt it, but I I definitely would be curious. But, um, do we have any more chats? Yeah, there are some more chats. Uh, hold on. I just had one thing on the bank thing. Um my understanding here though um with this women couldn't have bank accounts and I'd like to research it because on look I honestly it's not a specific category of like historical feminism that I'm aware of. What I've heard though is many banks they required married women to have a husband co-signing or a brother mostly but that was due to them being a unit. It was due to them not being able to secure credit. Pretty sure. Yeah, but I um um something about credit. Uh hold on. Something about banks. Anyways, here. Let me get through the chats just cuz we got to try to get this wrapped up soon. But we will get these chats read, guys. $69 TTS if you want to get it. You know what? Maybe we got to do a little more roast session. Hold on. We got Daniel here. Thank you, Daniel. Appreciate it. Daniel_Mace donated $69. It's funny. You say you care about men's mental health, then say let's go extinct in pursuit of women's jobs and autonomy. Doesn't sound like you care. Love logic though, right? I don't think women pursuing jobs means men's mental health has to be sacrificed in that process. I said an extreme thing that I think if people don't have autonomy, I don't see a point in in living. So that's I mean if I'm not going to live, you know, in a in an oppressed way if I don't have to. So I I don't know. That's how I feel. I think didn't you say earlier that uh when it came to like free will and agency, you wouldn't sacrifice that to uh save the human species? Correct. Question for you. What if you had to force one woman? Oh Jesus. Hold on. It's not going to be bad. She couldn't have a career. You had to force her. You're like, "No, lady." One lady, one lady, you can't have a career and you and if you you you put a a restriction on her free will, but it saves the entire human species. Do you do it? I'd be open to it, but she open to it. I'd be open to it. You Well, hold on. You'd be open to it. I'd be open to it. So, I have to sleep on it. I have to You got to sleep on it. She can't be a boss, babe. Hold on. She can't She can't be an HR rep lady. Hold on. Why can't she just be Why can't she just be a boss, Brian? A boss? Yeah. Why can't women are 43% of the entrepreneurs in this country? They can just be bosses. They don't have to be a boss babe. They can just be bosses. Oh, okay. We're Are we Is this like a criticism of the term boss babe? No. A little bit. A little bit. Women use this term. They do. They do. I'm not I'm not saying they don't. I'm not saying they don't. I'm not saying they don't. It's just sometimes let's just think about it. That's all. You're right. Okay. So, but you Oh, I you know would you would you do it? I'd have to have a long conversation with her. You Why would you got to Cuz I'm I'm restricting this woman's agency. I'd have to see. You have 10 seconds to make the choice. It's like the the uh trolley dilemma. So, okay. I hate the trolley dilemma. Yeah. So, save all of humanity. Save all of humanity or uh but if you don't, I would choose humanity. Okay. All right. Ridiculous question. Ridiculous question. Thank you, Josh Brooks. Josh Brooks donated $69. Appreciate it, brother. Lol. Boots on the ground is not a support role. See, you just reverted back to saying they should just be in support roles. What is your stance? I'm confused. I I don't know. I don't think I changed my stance. My stance is if I believe men should be the ones doing most of the combat. If women want to volunteer in support roles, they can. But if we're talking about a forced draft of women, which I don't advocate for. If we do a force draft of women, I don't advocate for them being combat roles. I advocate for them being in support roles. That's my position. Front straight to the front line. They don't even get training. You just here's a gun. Just send them. Lucas donated $69. Thank you, Lucas. One/Me steelman your position. Men have duties/obligations. BC. they should just do the right thing. But women shouldn't have any duties to society whatsoever. In other words, a definition of feminism. I mean, I I think when people are talking about women's duties, what are they actually talking about besides going to war, which I think most of us agree that that's not what we're trying to do. The only other option that I hear as like a duty for women is forcing them to have or they should have a duty to have children. I don't believe in that. So, unless you can come up with another duty that you think women should do, I'm open to it. But that's the only one I hear. All right, guys. Reminder, $69 TTS. If you want to get a roast in, guys, want to get a roast in. Lucas Lucas donated $69 is a female supremacy movement. Double salute. Wow. A woman has got you joyful trained real good. Oh, it it changed it. It said biat. Yeah, it changed. What? What? What word got changed? Wow. your woman has got trained. Female supremacy movement. Is he saying feminism is a female supremacy movement? The bread winner uh in your We've actually switched back and forth, but right now it's her. Okay. Yeah. But there were lots of times where I was. Yeah. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off there as you were I didn't understand his question honestly. Um no, I don't think feminism is a female supremacy. Yeah. He said, "In other words, your definition of of feminism is a female supremacy movement." I don't see it as supremacy in any way. It's equal opportunity. That's not supremacy. We have some super chats we're going to read. If you want $69 TTS, the state of things, yet another example of a feminist coming in and saying their observations of truth and women nature is bad and should be ignored because it hurts women. Oh, and ignore that it's bad for men and it sucks to suck, but suck it up, s I'm not sure what I'm saying is bad. Feminists truth of and women in nature is bad. I don't I don't know because it hurt. I don't know. I don't really know what to make of that. Oh, what the [ __ ] Sorry. I don't know what Sorry. I don't know what the [ __ ] that was. It was Andrew taking Did we Did I pull this one? I just pulled this one up, right? Yes. Yeah. All right, guys. $69 TTS. We have a few more coming through here. You know what we're going to Here's what we're going to do. We're going to do a $30 roast. We're going to lower it to 30. Then we're going to wrap the show. We're going to do uh $299 roast. If you want, you guys want to get it in. We'll do We'll do an actual roast roast session. You can roast me, guys. You can roast me. can roast the ghost of Andrew. Yep, he's still there. The ghost of Andrew passed or something. Uh, let me get that changed up. Um, do you have any final thoughts? Or actually, wait, no, we already did closing statement. Now we're just I'll repeat it to anybody who wants to hear it though, you know. So, are you down though to come back and do a round two? Absolutely. Absolutely. A thousand%. I wanted Jim Bob said he wanted to bait me too. Really? Yeah. I I cuz I was I was DMing him. Okay. We had an interesting conversation. So, I'd love to talk to Jim Bob, too, cuz I think he's got some interesting points. You're nearby. You're in SoCal, so we got Michael G. Men are more capable of war, so we have a draft, but if birth rates get too low, women are only capable of having kids. Should we force them to do so? Both result in a fallen nation. Michael G, thank you so much, man, for that super chat. A fair dilemma. I don't believe we should force anyone, but I definitely don't think we should force women to have children. All right, there it is, guys. We're doing a $30 TTS to wrap up the show. So, get it in. If you want to roast Raphael, it's Raphael. Bring it. Just want to make sure I [ __ ] that up. If you want to get a little roast in, we're doing that. Uh, hold on. Let me get that all set up here super quick. Uh, Raphael, what do you think about um what do you think about uh you know just abolishing feminist studies program programs in universities? Do you think that would be good? I don't. Are you on board? Not necessarily. I I I mean I personally believe if people want to study whatever they want in college, they can. Um, I don't Yeah, I mean, I don't think it's going to lead to a, you know, hiring career, but if people want to learn about the subject, I think that's okay. Oh, okay. Yeah, there you there you go. Um, but, you know, maybe we should just abolish it. What do you think? No, just get rid of Oh my god, I screwed this up already. Hold on. I can't type, guys. 29.90. There it is. Oh [ __ ] Dang it, guys. Get a roast in so I can uh so I can take a break real quick. Uh, all right. We have Josh Brooks here with another message. Thank you, Josh Brooks. Appreciate Josh Brooks donated $69. Thank you. Okay, but that's my point on your stance. You say you would be fine if they wanted to be on the front lines, but now you say they should be in support roles. Don't be wishy-washy. Pick one lane. Do you want to pick a lane? Um, what I'm saying is that if women volunteer to be on the front lines, go for it. But if we're conscripting women, I don't think we should force them to be on the front lines. Conscripting women shouldn't force them. I, you know, look, I would I think they should make it a uh like maybe HBO could host a pay-per-view for the war between women, you know, women versus women. And it's it's televised for pay-per-view. H yeah, it would we would raise a lot of the GDP would go up. It would be just on that. It would I'm surprised the United States government hasn't done like peak capitalism like Okay, we're going to do war pay-per-view. I mean, that [ __ ] would be insane. We'll be out of debt in no time. That would be crazy, son. Okay. Uh let's see. What do we have? What do we got? We got some We got some super chats, guys. It's been lowered. $30 TTS. Get a roast in if you want. Christopher, if the goal is equal opportunity and women have the opportunity to opt out of motherhood via abortion, why shouldn't men have the opportunity to opt out of fatherhood via surrendering paternal rights, not paying child support? Okay, so here's my my position on this. I think if the the woman and the and the man agree that he can, you know, forego his pronal rights and and you know, payment, the child support payments, which by the way, I want everybody to know their only average child support payment is $440. So, let's just pump the brakes here. Um, but if the man wants to for and the women agrees, totally cool with that. Um, but it's not equal opportunity because men do not have the opportunity to be pregnant. So, it's not equal opportunity and it can't be unfortunately in that situation. But you said, wait, hold on. You said if the woman agrees. So, what if the man cuz like what if the man's like, "Eh, it was a one night stand. I wasn't intending to be a father. We were just hooking up." She's like, "I'm going to keep the kid." I would agree is her right to do, right? I agree it's her right. And I think if a man I mean if you guys are also you know against promiscuity I mean men should know the risk of potentially impregnating somebody. And I believe that a man should take care of a kid if he has one. Now if they agree that hey I don't need you to be in his life or her life. It's totally fine. Let's sign a contract. You don't need to make child support payments. Hey that's between them. But I think if a man just opts out on his own I don't agree with that. But you're you are uh pro-choice, right? I am. Um and just curious uh do you have a cut off for I mean kind of. Okay. So it's tough. Um but something I've been mulling about I haven't given it that much thought but for example if a if someone has a miscarriage a death certificate is not issued right. Um I'm not sure. I believe a death I believe a death certificate for a miscarriage is not issued till about 20 weeks. If a miscarriage happens after 20 weeks, I think in the state of California, you that death certificate is issued. Well, what's your cut off for abortion? Probably 20 weeks. Okay. So, you favor of like third trimester abortion. And but the vast majority aren't done that late. Sure. Um, I guess though when it comes to the men having the right to escape, uh, child support for a child that they didn't want, uh, like what would you, if there was a man sitting across from you, sitting right there, Andrew, he was like, "Raphael, look, man. I'm I'm 21 years old. I I've been hooking up with this girl. I thought she was on birth control. She got pregnant. I'm not financially ready to have the kid. I just don't want to be a father. I'm not ready. Whatever it is, what would you tell them? I would tell them, do you think the woman is also in that position? Because if she is, you should help out. What do you mean if she's also not financially ready to take care of a child? Yeah. But what would you say to him in in the sense of the reasons he's given you for why he doesn't want I would say, yeah, that sucks. But if she's going to have the child and she's also not financially capable or ready in her life to do it, but she doesn't believe in abortion and she wants to have the child, then he should take care of it. And so now I want to switch it. Okay, you have a woman sitting there and she says the exact same thing. She says, "Look, you know, uh, my birth control failed. I don't want to have a kid. I'm not financially ready. I don't want to be a mother. I'm not ready to raise a kid. uh what would you say to her if it's before 20 weeks and my to be consistent I would say I don't think you should have the child because I don't think I don't agree my goal is children raise in great homes and if you are not ready to raise a child and that child could have a bad life just I don't believe in just breeding for the sake of breeding so if that child is not going to have a good life due to the circumstances I don't think it's I I I think she should be able to get uh termination of pregnancy and the guy who you were giving advice to. Uh would you maybe have you might say to him, for example, you should have thought of that before you had sex. For sure. I I would say that's a bad that's a bad on her to like Yeah, there consequences for having sex. And would you say that to the woman? Probably. Yeah. Okay. But she can always escape escape her situation through an abortion. Sure. Because she's the one that has to go through the pregnancy, right? But don't you think for the sake of equality, men should be granted in instances and cases and states where women do have abortion rights, men should have a corresponding right. Uh it's often called by men's rights activists as legal paternal surrender. The more uh the other term is paper abortion. They typically don't like that term, but but legal paternal surrender. Essentially, as a man, you could say, "Hey, uh I didn't want to have the kid. I don't want to be financially responsible for 18 years. I don't want I I relinquish any paternal rights uh parental rights that I have, but I don't want to be financially responsible for the kid. It seems to me if you're saying to the woman, well, you have this exit of and you didn't like this the way Andrew categorized this. Uh he considers it murder, right? You don't like that categorization. If the woman can murder the child, the unborn child, uh what would actually be wrong with then men wanting to just not have to be financially uh tied to the child? Yeah. Once it's born. Well, I want to clarify that I'm not necessarily saying equality. I'm saying equal opportunity. And men do not have the opportunity to be pregnant. So, I think women have that that's the sole thing they have the opportunity to do. So if they make the decision to keep the child, that is a risk men take if they impregnate somebody. And I think again from my worldview of masculinity, doing the right thing would be taking care of that child. So um if uh you know what's abortion then what do you mean? Well um just one point of clarification. you when you say you're against third trimester abortion, do you say like for your own like in terms of your own view, but like let's say a woman she wanted a third trimester abortion. Would you like by law do you think those should be precluded? Um I don't know. I that's tough. It's tough. I don't I wouldn't support it myself like hey if I if I if I somebody was pregnant they were 20 weeks past I wouldn't say you should get an abortion. But you would be open. Let's say there are there's a cohort of women out there who if they were pregnant and if they were in the third trimester and if they wanted to get an abortion, you would not have any guard rails or laws or anything like that preventing them from getting the abortion say at 9 months. I would need to understand, I think, the medical aspect of that a bit more because I know most abortions that take place early are done through pills and there's very it's it's quite simple of a process. If it's that late, I think it enters kind of a territory I'm uncomfortable with. So, I I'd have to I'd have to understand that a bit more. Yeah. No, you're you are right. Like when it's really early on in the the pregnancy, they can take a pill, which are the vast majority of abortions. Yeah. And uh but I I my understanding is once it gets a little further on in the pregnancy the I don't know the exact procedure. I I think they uh there there can still be pills or something that they take but they still then they have to remove the fetus and there's like maybe I heard again I'm not an expert this is not an expert field for me but uh they vacuum it out or something. I've heard that too. I have no idea. I I don't know. It could be fear mongering, but again, I know that the vast majority aren't done that way. Sure. Um, but yeah, in this hypothetical, you know, it is tough. I I definitely think if you're at 20 weeks and you haven't made a decision or you change your mind, I mean, that's a bad that's a bad place to be. It shouldn't be that way. All right, we got we're going to let the chats come through. We got Noodle Zoodle. Noodle Zoodle donated $30. Thank you, man. Appreciate it. I need an explanation as how equal opportunity is not a fancy way of saying female privilege. giving benefits without the consequences or responsibilities is the problem. But I also said that I don't believe men have inherent duties beyond my own view of what masculinity is. I don't believe men I don't believe you're born into this world and you're automatically given a duty. Um so I I it's consistent in my view with women. I don't consider that privilege at all. If a man doesn't want to do the right thing and be a piece of garbage, well their men do that every day. they're able to do that without any sense of duty. I feel the same way about women. If they don't want to, you know, I don't think they're inherently given a duty at birth that they must adhere to beyond obviously obeying the laws, which there's consequences for if you don't. All right, I'm going to just let these chats come through. There's quite a few. We got Nick. Nick donated $30. Thank you. Appreciate it, man. Brian, you need to take a bio break. I've seen better moderating on a leftist Tik Tok panel. Raphael, you're a [ __ ] who prescribes the same DGEN behavior as Destiny, but with dumber arguments. I don't think I promote degeneracy. I mean, I personally don't have a problem with like high body counts, but that doesn't mean I'm saying you should. If you don't, if you have a preference for not a high body count, you're within your right to do that. Absolutely say this is not what I'm looking for. Everyone has preferences. You should pick people based on your preferences. Wait, I think during the show Andrew might have asked you this, but uh I know you're married, but if you were single or when you were single, would you like let's say you knew like the girl told you or some [ __ ] she has a body count of He said like a thousand. He said, I think he said like five five Yeah. figure 10,000. Sure. Would you would you hit um as long as I got a STD test back and I cared about the person? Yeah. 10 10,000 bodies. If there's no STD or risk to me, then why not? What about what about let's Okay, cuz you could maybe say, okay, the body count, yeah, she has she's [ __ ] 10,000 dudes, but it was like 5 years ago. Yeah. And she's been celibate for a minute. Yeah. Right. But how about this? You're on a date with a girl. Mhm. And she just [ __ ] 10 dudes last night without a rubber. I probably wouldn't feel comfortable with that. Let's say she's clean. She's clean. I don't know. It's If she's clean, then I don't futuristic STD test that like, okay, knows right away if she's got some if I'm single, she's clean, and we like each other. I I I What if though? I'm still going to bust. I mean, whatever. Huh? What the [ __ ] I said it. Press one of the buttons. What the Here. What the [ __ ] There it is. Wait, so she just [ __ ] Yeah. What about like an hour before you guys I mean, this is I'm not in like a Bonnie Blue situation. Like I'm not going to be one of the guys lined up at the door, but I'm saying yes. I'm saying if the night before she did her thing, you know, I'm not in love with the idea, but I'm saying if I'm vibing with somebody, I'm single and like we're vibing and we're going to have a good time, I I wouldn't turn it down. I just wouldn't be like, "Oh man, I can't do I'm not going to do this." Do you um She There's literally the dude's Don't say it. ejaculated. Oh, come on. inside. Are you gonna have sex with her, bro? Probably with a condom, but yeah. Wait. Huh? Huh? Huh? Bro, you gonna have sex with a woman who has another dude's sperm inside her. I'm vibing with somebody. That is not going to it'd be enough to stop me. No, dude. I don't care. Let me tell you this, bro. I don't care how hot she is. I don't care how much how great the vibe is. She could be the most based, submissive housewife bowing. You have an issue with the bow, by the way. I I don't know why you hate the bow so much. You know what, Raphael? You think is your You think your wife is watching? Uh, I think she is. She's probably waiting to pick me up at some point. You know, maybe do the bow. See if she just try it. See if you like it. If she just have her hit a bow and I You know what? You might be a convert. I might convert you, dude. I might convert you. Um I don't I don't know. I think I I just when it comes to submission, it's just one of those things that this is like a relic of the past. And I think now we're living in a world where women are making, you know, young women are are advancing faster than young men right now. Like young women are buying homes more. They're making more money now. True. So it's like the idea of like, well, I only want a submissive wife. It's like I think you're missing out on some great relationship potential. Maybe not. Maybe not. I just think I have met some awesome boss babes. Have you ever had I just use How dare you? You misogynist. I [ __ ] up. Have you ever had a woman do everything you say? I maybe at one point maybe when I was younger. Yeah. In Florida. In Florida. Yeah, probably. But just to be clear, I a clarification. If you're really vibing with a girl, if she's leaking a jacket, hold on. You said inside, not leaking. That's a different story. I mean, we're talking about 24 hours. We're talking about 24 hours. We're talking about 24 hours. Sometimes a girl is going to be Look, she's got [ __ ] another dude's splooge. It If the condom is on, it's on. That's all I'm saying. If there was actively another man's semen in a woman's vagina, but you had and it was the best condom ever. It even covered your balls. This Sorry, that's getting [ __ ] den, dude. You would smash. If If it was that kind of If I was that kind of night. Yeah. If it was that kind of night. That's [ __ ] disgusting. What do you mean that kind of night? You're liquored up. You got some tequila or what? If it's that kind of night, you can't let the party. Let's get going. Look, you're a married man and you It's not an open, right? You guys are monogamous, right? Okay. So, this is a hypothetical, you know? I'm just saying if you ever find yourself single again, you can't be [ __ ] girls who have another man's seat in them. You can't do that, Raphael. You can't do that. That's That's weird. I don't know, man. If two people are going to have a good time, I I can look past it. That's all. I can look past it. I want cobwebs in that [ __ ] dude. I can't deal with a girl. If she's [ __ ] a guy, why though? Why, Brian? Why? Yeah, bro. There's got I can't The thought it's It's just gross. It's just inherently gross. You can't you can't be having sex with a woman and she's got another dude's seat in her. I'm sorry, Raphael. It I'm not saying it's my preference, but I'm saying I wouldn't say no if the vibe is right. What question for you? What if she's like, I don't want you to wear rubber? Absolutely not. And she's on birth control. Absolutely not. And she has uh her tube style. Absolutely not. When I was When I was single, when I was single, I always wore a condom. Period. She can't get pregnant. It's not about pregnancy. And she No STDs either. But the the man's seed is No, even in the sugar. When I was single, I still I had work on it every time. So, no, but she can't get pregnant. She's got a [ __ ] hysterctomy. She's got a hysterctomy. No STDs. Her pussy's immune to STDs. It just doesn't matter. I pretty much only go raw with like long-term partners. That's pretty much how I do it. But no, but why work? No STDs. No STDs. She can't get pregnant. It just What's the point? It's just I don't know about you. If Here, let me let me I mean, this woman's obviously hot enough that I'm considering this. So, I think the comm is going to be just fine. She's very hot. The comm is going to be fine. But she's she's already has another man's seat in her, but it'll be mission accomplished either way, so it'll be fine. I can't do that. I can't. But, you know, the crazy thing, you're like, I' I'd wear rubber. Uh me personally, if a girl was like, Brian, I'm not ready to have sex yet, but I'll give you a hand job. I'd be like, I'm okay. I I don't even want like have you ever had like if a if that's all that's on the table like have you you've turned down hand jobs, right? Have you turned down nothing's coming to mind? You've never turned down a hand job? Like she's like I guess I could give you a hand job. I'm like let's just not do anything. Nothing's coming to mind. There might be a time but I don't nothing's jumping out at me. So wait, just to be clear though, if she has the seed of multiple men inside her, possibly an animal, let's include an animal. Oh, come on, man. Now we're talking animals. Like, we're talking beastiality. Animals are freaky, bro. No, they're not beastiality. Some of these, bro, you should see these these fantasies. These women with the dogs, dude. Bro, who you bringing on the show, Brian? We've had multiple women say they've made sweet, passionate love to animals. There was a horse girl, right? Or uh Whoa. That's Wasn't there a trees? She was in the trees. The trees. Sap. Sap. Would you have would you be with a woman who has sap inside of her from a a fus? As long as it can't hurt me and I'm wearing a condom or redwood, it might be a redwood. If I'm wearing a condom and no one's going to get hurt. Yeah. If I'm attracted to them, you're still going to bust. So, just to be clear one more time, busting is busted. If if a woman just had sex and he was Andrew Tate and his This is getting kind of like a little sus. This is getting really sus. I don't know. And his seed was in her and you were but she's really hot and you guys are vibing. Are you going to have sex with a woman who has another man's seed in her? If it's Andrew Tates. Does that make you want to do it more? I'm Do you want to do it more? A little bit. I got to one up Andrew Tate. I'll show that girl how I really put it down. Yeah, I'll [ __ ] I'll convert her to the blue pill. But okay, removing the Andrew Tate thing. You would have sex with a woman 24 hours after. I can't do that, bro. I understand. I I understand. I'm not there. I understand. She could, but that's your preference, which is great. She could be like I'm an average looking guy. I'm not the best looking guy, right? She could be leagues beyond. She could be so [ __ ] hot. Like it would be it would like if I got her pregnant, right? It would be a blessing to my future children, right? Cuz she gets, you know, my children get the good looks, whatever. She could be so the hottest woman to ever lived, [ __ ] smoking, great personality, whatever. And if another guy [ __ ] her recently, I don't want it. I can't do it, bro. I can't do it. I get it. I I just But you would. I just feel like you're missing out. That's all. That's all. Bro, I can't do it. I understand. You can't bring yourself to do it. I understand. I can't do it. You can't do it. But it's like you saying I can't eat In-N-Out and I'm like, dude, you should try it. It's really great. It's the same thing. It's like you're missing out. But I can't do it. I understand. That's fine. But I love In-N-Out. So, I would recommend you to have In-N-Out. That's all I'm saying. Look, I don't think it's fair to compare In-N-Out. I do to [ __ ] with another man's comment. Have you ever had In-N-Out? All the time. It's like my favorite. It's my favorite thing. All right. Let me Let me try to get this rap. We It's It's not your fault. It's my fault. I'm just talking about weird [ __ ] It's fine. Nameless name. Seven donated $30. What the previous guy said, your world view is too in the middle. Doesn't solve the problem of good versus evil, my guy. Thank you. Appreciate it. I mean, yeah, I think but I think beyond, you know, I I think what some people consider good and evil are different. I mean, Brian and I just had a whole conversation about it. I think people have different ideas of what's good and what's bad. So, it's hard for me to say, "Hey, this is absolutely 100% good." I don't necessarily believe that. I have my my worldview and um I respect others mostly. What What do you think about pegging? If you like it, go for it. Do you? I don't. No. No. Okay. I'm not I'm not into butt stuff in general either way. Okay. Just joking. Sons of Liberty donated $29.99. These liberals always come down to blaming white males specifically for their problems. He'll always be a victim. Would you be okay and allow your wife to flower and other men that she wanted to? I don't consider myself a victim at all. Um I I don't know where you're getting that from, but I I feel like my life's pretty damn good. Brood for donated $30. Andrew couldn't even shake this guy's hand at before he left. What a beta. Damn, he called Andrew a beta. That's [ __ ] up. Wait, is he calling you a beta or I think he's calling He's probably calling me a beta. Well, it seems like directed at Andrew, maybe. I don't know. Well, honestly, if if we wrapped the show, does he normally shake hands? I don't know. But if we wrapped the show and you guys, you know, we you guys were leaving at the same time, he'd I think he'd shake your but you were over here. He was over there. No, I Yeah, I didn't take it personal. Andrew Andrew's like even even the kind of heated nature of this conversation like after the show he'll be like it was good talking to you cuz I debated him on the show. It was the same thing. It was heated. It was back and forth and it was like man it was fun. Honestly, it was one of the more more heated debates he's had. I thought it was good. I thought it was good. I didn't know I I just I'm just used to zero $30. Raphael, your main problem is that you equate duties/obligations with being oppressed. Also, you would force men to die to save the nation, but you won't force women to have children to do the same. To save the nation. I I don't equate uh duties with oppression. Oppression is systematic denial of rights and resources. Duties are automatic obligations that you just have for existing. And so, I don't agree with that. All right. Thank you, brood. Josh Brooks donated $30. Thank you, Josh. Appreciate. Bring back the gladiator arenas. only blue hair and naval piercings against sleeve tattoos and septum piercings. Also, whoever has the most abortions under her belt gets to handle the tiger cage free. All right, thank you for that. Uh Josh, really appreciate it. We have Noel here. Thank you, man. Appreciate it. Noel Ramos donated $30 about population collapse. There's no solution that keeps women's rights without marginalizing a population of men. Some suggest rethinking family structures. Why should men sign up for this future? I don't know how men will continue to be marginalized because women have more rights. I'm not sure how that works. Um, family structures I do think we need to reconsider because I think a lot of what red, excuse me, what red pill and other ideologies say is like it should be man is the provider, man is auh protector, woman is the child uh, you know, bearer, uh, you know, is is at home. I think we live in a world where that's different now. I think we live in a world where women are out earning some men. So, it's like maybe we rethink about it. I think, you know, I don't judge stay-at-home dads the way a lot of like red pillars would. I think, hey, if that works with a family, and I've talked to a lot of women who say, "My husband is a stay at home dad, and I love him more than anything." That works for them. So, I I just I think we could rethink family structures. Grahams donated $30. Thoughts on Republicans part of 2025 trying to ban unicorn? It's about corn. Corn adult content. Yeah. Um, I get the argument for it, but all in all, if everyone is a party, you know, to say this is what I choose to do, then I I I don't want to remove that agency personally. All right, we got su zero donated $30. What is this guy's opinion on the Alina laws being voted on in Mexico right now? It basically makes it legal for women to kill any man simply if they feel threatened or intimidated by him. I haven't looked into that, but that seems pretty wild. I mean, if if a man is essaying somebody or assaulting somebody, I mean, you got to do what you got to do, but just feeling general threatened, I'd have to look into it, but that seems a bit overkill. All right, we have Silent DJ here for a video. Silent donated $30. Check your ex for a video roast. This cut got nuked by Andrew. I don't see any I don't see any DMs, man. But uh I'm not sure if we'll be able to pull it up, unfortunately. But uh we got Lucas here. Big donated $69. Big Lucas, thank you. Bro, I just threw up in my mouth. Just venturing a guess here, but am I correct in assuming that there's a worn out chair strategically situated in the corner of your bedroom? Uh, no. You are absolutely incorrect. I believe he's referring to a cuck chair. Yeah, I understand. As they call it. Yeah, I know. That's a very common thing that people say. I don't know what about me makes you think I'm not masculine. I mean, I I don't get it. Just because I have some different beliefs I'm not masculine. I don't know, man. Let's have a push-up contest. Would that would that would that prove something? You know what, Lucas? Lucas, you're a friend of the show. Fly out to the fly out for the round two. You and Raphael will do a push-up contest. So, if that proves what is masculine to some of these guys, then let's do it. Wait, question. If Lucas wins, though. Yeah. What What are we wagering here? I think we're wagering I think we're wagering whether or not I'm a beta cuck. I will admit I'm a beta cuck if he beats me in a in a in a push-up contest. What if uh h I was going to wager the whatever channel, but that sounds like a really bad thing. I can't run this thing. I can't run this thing to to wager. Uh all right. Thank you, uh Lucas. Appreciate it, man. Jason Castle donated $30. Okay, it took so long to get back to on the percent of men in war/20th century question. I decided to do the calculations myself and fem boy is correct. Hey Jason, I apologize for calling you a dummy on that question. Jason, it takes a it takes a lot of courage and I think it's very masculine to admit you were wrong. It's funny that you said I'm a fanboy, but you apologize for calling me a dummy. That That's progress, man. That's really cool. Now, if he gets something else wrong, he has to apologize for the fem. Yeah. And then he'll come up with another name. And uh Yeah. All right, Jason Cassell. Appreciate it, man. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. He also wants to do a push-up competition with you, by the way. This is all the guys I wanted to put on. So NZ donated $30. You don't seem like a bad guy and your arguments after Andrew left have been decent. However, at the start, refusing to define anything and getting angry was poor form and made you look clueless. I agree. But I think even when I was messaging you, I said, "I'm not a debater." Like, and Andrew is a debater to the core. Me and Brian are having a good conversation. He has different ideas. I have different ideas. We're getting more done now than when Andrew since when Andrew left. So that's why it gets frustrating. He's a good debater. He can trap me in things and I'm not as good at him as and I'll admit that. So yeah, you know the we are getting a lot done. We were talking about a a jackallet. Ejaculate. That's one. That was good. That was a good one. Jason Castle donated $30. Progress, guys. I was doing only men that fought in wars. My bad. That would make sense. I still think you are a degenerate and you lost the debate. I'll still fight you. I'm not even going to, you know, if I lost the debate, I lost the debate. I came here with a specific mission. That's fine. But if you want to spar, man, let's do it. Like, let's meet here. We'll spar. All right, Jason. You know, hey, Jason, you can't back down from a a fight. I would, you know, a friendly spar. I I think though I should start offering like a whatever boxing event. Dude, that's it. You know, boxing event where But just for like equality, do you would it be okay with you if like the men box the women? No, because I think doing the right thing is not hurting someone that equal equal rights equal less. Equal opportunity. You keep strongmaning my feminism position. That is not my position on feminism. And I my position on masculinity is doing the right thing which includes protecting the innocent. Can I hurt? Do you know Gorlock? So that's a transgender woman. Can I box her? Oh, I thought it was the one that Rachel was arguing. She No, she mad Marge. She was calling her. Can I box Gorlock? Is that fair? It's a If Gorlock agrees. If Gorlock agrees, you're okay with it. You give the blessing. Okay, just checking. All right, we got 30 here. Oh, this is a positive one for you. 30 donated $30. Hello, Raph. I am not a feminist. I agree with 90% of the things you have said, especially about red pill. I wanted to show you support in the face of all the hate. Oh, wow. Keep doing the good work. All right. That means a lot to me, 30. Thank you. All right. We got Josh Brooks here. Thank you, Josh. Appreciate it, brother. Josh Brooks donated $30. You don't want women to be on the front line if it's conscription because of force. You're okay if they choose. You concede women should be in support roles. Women being hurt equals bad. So, no choice. I just think I don't know if something's getting lost in translation, but I think if it comes to conscription, I don't want to force women on the front lines. But if they choose to be on the front lines, go for it. But if we are conscripting women, I would prefer they be in support roles, unless they want to be on the front line. Intel Wild donated [Music] $29.99. This guy is a piece of [ __ ] He might as well start sucking off dudes and color his hair blue already. Only thing good about him is that he's from the OC area. I mean, he's representing OC, so you're not all bad, dude. Intel, are you in the OC? Are you in the OC? In OC represent. Oh, here we uh Oh, wait. Jason Cassell with a followup here. Jason, I said fight, not spar. There is a big difference. He wants to fight you. He doesn't want Jason. Look, I got too much to lose, man. I'll spar with you, but I'm not getting into a a knockdown brawl because, you know, people get hurt. You know, I got too much to lose. We got Lucas here still in the chat. Lucas donated $30. Oh, brother, you want to engage in a bit of playground [ __ ] talk. Not to be self arandizing, but I'm 6'4 in 235 lb and still bench over 300 lb of my old age. Let's get Lucas. Challenge accepted. Let's do it. Even if he's not here, Lucas, just come by the studio. Uh 64200. Damn, bro. Giga, Chad, dude. Yeah, for sure. No, I'm not going to talk [ __ ] to you, Lucas. We're We're bros, homie. Wow, that was Me and Lucas are bros. No, we're bros. Well, you know, the thing is though is that it was a push-up contest, right? Right. So, it's like, you know, like the thing is is that Well, at least with pull-ups, this is a bit different. Like a a guy who's really light, he can do more like more pull-ups than a guy who's like big and shredded, but Exactly. There's a little bit of a like equilibrium there, but push-ups are a little different. They're different. I can't bench as much as that, but I'd be down to do a push-up contest. All right, Lucas, push-up contest. Get it. Get out here to California. You got your I don't want to spar Lucas. C Lucas, can you be on camera if you with your job? But uh he's a lawyer. Uh, Michael G, now that you're friends with Brian, look him in the eyes and call him a misogynist that's causing men to f11 themselves. So, unlive. Yeah. Well, here's what I'll say. Look me deep in my eyes. You got blue eyes, too. I didn't know that. I didn't know that till just now. Um, [ __ ] I mean, [ __ ] I just I walked into that. Um, so I don't know that I can call you directly a misogynist. No, I can't do that. But I do think What about all this? What about all this, Raphael? It's not only you. What is this? A lot of your panel does it. A lot of the people on your side do it. It's not just you. I think you're actually a pretty cool dude. So, but the thing is I think the show sometimes does promote that stuff. And I think the guys who are angry find it to be, "Oh my god, women do suck. Yeah, I agree with with this the show. Women do are the worst. I hate them. They have no logic. They're stupid." And I just think the guys who are already deep red pill, that's what they're going to continue to believe. So, that's the only thing I'm trying to do. Dude, I do your show. I, you know, do your thing. I'm just saying I I hope that there are men out there that aren't like going deeper into it because studies show they do. That's all I'm trying to I I don't want guys to unal alive themselves. I It's just the thing. And I'm not saying you're the cause of it, but I'm saying because they're probably watching other content, too. It's not just this. But all of that reinforces it in my opinion. You know, I think people who watch my show, they actually love women more. They love women more because they, you know, you got to go into something with your expectations managed. And the blue pill thing is is you're going to have a sense of what your experience is going to be with dating. But if you go in to dating knowing full well what that's going to entail, then you're not going to be surprised when certain things happen and which will enable you to have an understanding of women and have a have your expectations managed. And if your expectations are managed and you don't believe in this Disney fairy tale [ __ ] when it comes to dating and I think women have a lot of this isn't just men's view of women. I think women need to lose the Disney [ __ ] too when it comes to to men also. Uh yeah I think they have I think some have lofty expectations of what women have of dating. Yeah. But I think both men and women have been sold this like disnified uh sort of ideal which is just not realistic. whatsoever. And so for this reason, I actually think if you're going into dating or your encounters with your girlfriend or whatever it is with with uh managed expectations, you're not going to end up disappointed because you know exactly what you're getting into. And I think that that makes for a much healthier relationship than having these uh unrealistic expectations whether you're a man or a woman when it comes to dating and relationships. I think there's a fair point in what you're saying. I think um you know, let's dispel the fairy tale that there are people out there that have shitty ideals, shitty preferences. There's shitty people out there and not every woman's great, not every man is great. Um, I think that's okay to to say that, but I feel like, um, it's constantly the expect. Okay, so I'll tell you, you know, my TikTok blew up pretty quickly. It's doing pretty good. The comments I get from men constantly when I ask women, would you date a man under 6 feet tall? All the women said yes. Every single one I asked. I know. So what they say, but the common thing I get from every red pill guy who's also single says, "Watch what they do, not what they say." But I'm interviewing married people and these people are married to people under six foot. So I'm watching what they do and but men can't believe it because of what they're hearing in the red pill space. They're hearing that women only want these preferences and that they're never going to get anybody and they're hearing that message over and over again. Well, I mean to to your point a little bit. So, we asked the height question on our our show and even women on our show, it's not like the these super brutal black pills where they're like, "Oh, I only want to date a 65 giga Chad." No, the women say, "I'm 5'7. I'll date a guy who's 5'. I'm 5 foot. I'll date a guy who's 5'4." You know, they're like, "As long as he's taller than me." And I I don't think that the women are lying necessarily, but I I think you are to some degree misrepresenting the red pill position on this maybe, which is I men they're not saying that it's perhaps a black pill position. Okay, if you're not 6 foot, you're just never going to get a girl. I the red pill position is acknowledging the reality that women have a general preference towards tall men. Do you do you disagree that generally speaking, women have a preference for taller men? Not to say that they wouldn't date a guy who's 5', but generally if they had like a choice between the guy who's 63 versus the guy who's 5'9, they probably But it's the same way guys would rather have Sydney Sweeney than, you know, some girl they just met on Tinder. Like men have the same kinds of preferences in terms of the extremes. So I totally agree with you that but I think what happens is men get frustrated that women have those preferences and and it makes them feel like they're excluded. And I don't think that's necessarily the case because men follow Instagram models and they think, "Oh my gosh, she's so hot. This is who I'd rather date." But then they might meet somebody in the street and just because they don't look like that or feel that, they don't feel like the attraction. And so I'm saying you're saying the men don't feel attraction towards the women. Correct. Oh well, I think that's men shouldn't follow prescriptively. I would say men should follow like IG models. Yeah. But you're right. And I I think that's a dangerous precedent for men. Well, like watch porn or anything. Yeah. Yeah. Of I and I can get behind that. I think porn is setting men up for unrealistic expectations for the world. And so they get upset because they feel rejected, but they see women have these preferences for what they consider gigachads. And it's like, yeah, if a woman had all the say in the world, she'd probably want to be with that. But the guy she ends up with is probably not going to be that. And you're missing out, I think, on great opportunities to meet women and have a good relationship. Well, I do want to address your your I guess comment or perhaps criticism of you said that you do these street interviews and the the answers that the women give you. You're saying that they're counter to some of the narratives for example when it comes to height, right? And the the rebuttal that you probably receive is uh look at women look at what women do, not what they say. You probably get that all the time. That's the comment I get. But do you think that there's a component of truth there? Like I agree with you that women aren't aren't just like wholesale lying about every single thing they say. However, I also think that and this perhaps also applies to men too is that people want to give the answer that sounds good. And I think that this men do this too, but I think women do it a little bit more. And so they want to give the politically correct answer, the an answer that sounds good. Women don't want to uh give an answer that might paint them as potentially superficial or uh paint them in like a bad light. So, they're going to say, "Oh, I don't care about height." But, for example, what we've done on the show is, you know, you ask a woman, "Well, you don't care about height." But we just ask them, Yeah, I've seen it. How tall of all your long-term relationships, how tall have they been in a girl, for example? Not all the time. Not all the time, though. To be fair, like sometimes the girl, yeah, I dated a guy who's uh my my current boyfriend's 5'7. I dated a guy who's 5'9. But we've also had women who's who are like, well, I I'm 5'4 and I would date a guy who's 5'6. And then they're like, well, my last three boyfriends were all 6'3. So, it's like, well, that's a really small percentage of men uh in that in terms of uh the uh the what's the term? uh percentile, the height percentile, like 6' 3, you're in like the 99th percentile. Um, but again, I think women will often say, uh, the politically correct feelgood answer to these things, and I don't always think that they're honest about it. And they did do a study on this. I can't recall what, but they asked women to compare, I think it was six traits. Yeah. And I don't know if you've seen this. There's this infographic floating around. It was like, uh, what are the like the six most important things? I think I've seen this. And one of them was like good looks, intelligence, um, money. I can't remember the other ones. And they, uh, I'm trying to remember when they looks was like at the bottom of their stated preferences, but then I don't recall exactly what the study did, but I think they showed them like images of men or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I know the study. Yeah. And then but uh their so there was a massive difference between their stated preference and their actual preference and their actual preference was more towards physical attraction as compared to what their uh stated preferences were. And the other thing final I know you want to respond last thing on this is just if you ask women if they think lizo is beautiful they'll say yes. Right. But do they really think that? I know what you're saying. I mean I don't know if you're a chubby chaser. I don't want to put words in your mouth. I'm just saying uh when it comes to physical attractiveness, yeah, I think it's a tough sale to say that somebody who's like I'm not saying this to be insulting towards Lizo, she's just factually morbidly obese or maybe she's been losing weight a little bit too. I think most most people when it comes to appraisals of physical attractiveness are not going to say like somebody who's morbidly obese is physically attractive. Generally speaking, most people wouldn't find that attractive. I hear what you're saying and I got to lose a bit of weight, guys. I'm getting a little obese. Okay, go ahead. We got to cut out that in and out. But um no, I think uh I think you're on to a lot of things and I I I don't disagree that maybe some of these women are answering this way. But that's why on my long form podcast, I interview married women because I want to interview women who are actually, you know, putting their money where their mouth is. A lot of the women I interview have either said, "I have dated men under six foot." or one of my more popular videos is, "Would you date a man who earns less money than you?" And all but one woman said yes. And that woman was, you know, being honest, which I appreciate. Um, when I did the six-foot video, the last woman I interviewed, she was like, "Well, clearly." And she points to her husband who's like her height, you know, and it's just like this is great. It's a it's a See, so I do see that women are putting their money where their mouth is. Now, in that study, I if I remember correctly, they listed their preferences, but then they were shown photos. And I think photos is always going to be a bit superficial. Like, I think photo, it's like kind of like Tinder and all that stuff. It's very superficial. I think what makes somebody attractive isn't necessarily just looks. I think looks are the first thing you notice. But I asked another question to women. What's more attractive? Looks or confidence? And every woman says confidence. Now, do looks get you in the door? Sure. But I think a confident man who's averagel looking has a shot. If he has got a if he approaches a woman with confidence, has some personality, has a sense of humor, he's got a shot. I'm not saying more than the gigachad or whatever they call him, but he's got a shot. And a lot of women end up marrying those kinds of guys. And I think the stats alone speak to it. I think only 14% of the population is uh over 6' tall um or 6t and over. But about 50% of households are married. So obviously women are marrying guys who are under six feet tall. Yeah, I would say most people uh probably a good amount of people in terms of getting married, it's actually if we're talking about socioeconomics, they're marrying people or in their socioeconomic class. On the confidence thing though, um I mean I don't think there's any dispute even in the uh the red pill space and there's some dispute of whether I even am red pill, but um nobody denies that confidence is a bolster when it comes to attracting women. I think the conversation though is that uh and this is I don't even think it's a red pill position really. I think it might be like they're like yeah confidence is really important. I think it's more Blackpill. The Blackpill guys who are like, "No, it doesn't matter." Like, uh, it's all looks. Yeah. Heights, looks, face, all that stuff. I mean, but they're not totally wrong. Like, if you're really unattractive and you're the most confident guy ever, not saying you're not going to get a girl, but like the this idea that confidence is like the cure all for getting like it's some magic, right? uh wand for getting any woman. I don't think that's the case. I agree. And and the other component though is that I think men who are confident uh are going to fare better in person. So like an averagel looking guy, but he's like got good personality and he's confident in person. I think he's going to do well. I think he's going to do well. The issue is though is that uh the majority of people uh at least from what I've seen are meeting online. So that confidence, that personality doesn't really translate. And so if people are meeting on Instagram, dating apps, etc., uh, and I my understanding from some statistics I've seen, maybe it's wrong, the majority of people are meeting online in some capacity, they're meeting on dating apps. So somebody's confidence or personality doesn't really have an opportunity to uh express itself online. These women are swiping on the dating apps. They're just looking for a hot dude. They're going to see the hot guy first. And look, if he's like a little [ __ ] then yeah, he's going to be in trouble. But if he has like a mod of ability to have a conversation with a woman and he's good-looking and she's already physically attracted to him, he's going to do okay. Where even if his confidence maybe isn't like exceptional. Yeah. Um I agree. And I think that's kind of why I I want to encourage men. I think that's why I do on the street interviews is because I'm approaching women randomly. They have no idea why I'm approaching them. I think most of the time they're like pretty they feel pretty comfortable with me. But um I'm trying to encourage men to do that more because personal on the dating apps is a losing game. You're outnumber you men outnumber women 3 to1 so they're already on a losing game like there are yeah the dating app I want men to get off the dating apps and I think they're kind of on the decline. I know I think statistically recently more people I agree with them. So I I'm encourage I want to encourage more people to go meet people in real life because that's when your personality can shine and that's when your confidence can shine. That's when your sense of humor can shine. And if you feel like I don't have enough money or I don't have enough this, it's like honestly there are guys at McDonald's that are married. There are guys at Walmart that are married. There are guys at gas stations that are married. And I'm not saying that's the norm, but it's possible. And I think people can find love and partnership. And that's all I'm trying to push for. That's really it. Um because I I'm not saying like I'm like a huge natalist, but I think there's a common ground in what a lot of the red pill and and a lot of these other people think is that at the end of the day, we do want to have a thriving population. And how do you do that? You get people together. And right now, there's too much of a divide. So, I'm trying to limit that divide as much as I can. That's that's my mission. That's what I'm trying to do. And I you know, it's I'm brand new to this. Um but any guy I can reach with that, it's like I I know what it's like to not have confidence. I know what it's like to feel like you're never going to date a girl. Um, and it's sad and I don't I hate that feeling for men and I know a lot of men feel that way. So, um, I just want them to not feel like if you don't have six figures, six foot, six-pack abs, and no woman's ever going to like you cuz I just don't think that case because average men are. And I go to Disneyland. I go to all these places. I look around. I'm like, look at all these people in relationship. Look at all these guys and girls. They're just so normal looking. people you don't see online. I I don't think there's a dispute here necessarily. Uh there's a lot of average people who are dating other average people. Yeah. Um but I think that there there are a couple issues here. Um and again, I don't think anybody disputes this. Yes. If you go out into the public, you'll see like a looks matched couple. You you'll see it all the time. There is though a cohort of both men and women who with their own dating experiences are encountering certain things as it relates to it's not all women but there are quite a few women who have uh let's say delusional expectations as it relates to their dating prospects. Agreed. Agreed. Um, and perhaps the same could be said, I think, for a smaller portion of men. Men seem to, at least my assessment, men seem to be more realistic as it relates to their dating prospects. And the the you see, you also mentioned you have an issue with like the looks rating thing, but I'll I'll explain I think why. So, and this is what I explain to the women. And I know you don't like the rating thing, but I think it's important. And and here's why. Is because women have uh sexual access to um men who are who I would argue are outside of their league. Whereas a man, if you uh if you step to a woman who's outside of your league, and I'm at the moment I'm just talking about looks. I know what you mean. But like men can bolster their prospects with status, money, confidence, personality. There's ways men can bolster and date out of their league by making up for it with those things I just mentioned. Yeah, agreed. But because women But the thing is though, generally speaking, I would say like the average guy, for example, uh most average men can't be [ __ ] right? Right. I I think that most average men don't have access to hookup culture. Yeah, I agree. Uh they can't go and like sleep with a new woman every single day of the week. Yeah. Every single woman, even below average, I'm not even talking about average women. I'm talking about below average women. If they were so inclined, they could be [ __ ] Yeah. If they wanted to, if they turn it on, they could. Any woman can be a [ __ ] Agree. Very few men can be [ __ ] And so what you have happening is essentially you have women who have sexual access, limited sexual access cuz they're not getting commitment, but they have limited sexual access to men outside their league. So what happens there? uh you you basically you have a lot of women who are chasing after men who um frankly would never commit to them, right? And this is a cycle that women could get into in their 20s as they're dating. Yeah. And these men uh and look, here's prescriptively uh I don't think men should sleep with women if they don't have a genuine bonafide intention of being in a relationship with that girl. I don't think men should be promiscuous. I don't think men should be promiscuous. I think that's a healthy message. But in a situation where we have completely uh uh we have a global sexual marketplace, uh things are completely li liberated. Women can hop on a dating app and [ __ ] a really attractive guy and it can be done without like the prying eyes of their social circle and their peer group. You have women who are going to hook up with these men. You have men who are also going to hook up with these women for a different reason though. Yeah. Um, and so because of this, you have women who it the way I often describe it is this what have you ever been in a dorm room? Uh, you ever lived in a dorm room? I never lived, but I I've experienced that. You ever like had housemates or roommates? Uh, yes, but like in a like off-campus house. But yeah. Okay. And you shared a bathroom or something? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, you currently uh I assume you and your wife live alone. Uh, yes. Just us and our dogs. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's really hard to go from uh from having like let's say you live in a mansion to going to live in a shared having roommates, not housemates, roommates, people who live in the same room as you and you share a bathroom with three people. Similar to that, if a woman has dealt with a certain caliber or tier of men, it's going to be kind of like you're like, "Okay, this is my league because I can sleep with these men." But you're for women, their league is the men that they can get into long-term committed relationships with. So these men will entertain short-term sexual relation limited short-term sexual relationships with these women. Men don't have that same ability to secure like to secure that. I so for this reason there's this differential that exists between men and women where essentially you do have a cohort of women who's like well I'm they're perpetually chasing men who are out of their league because it's like the breadcrumb of like I can get a guy who's more attractive. We all want the best, right? As men, we want to get the most attractive, good personality woman, whatever the whatever the, you know, whether we want to shoot for that. Yeah. Like we all want to get the best that we can get, right? Uh and same with women. Women want to get the best mate that they can get. But again, going back to what I was saying, men get insta rejected. So men have to be like if I step to a girl who's a 10 out of 10 Victoria Secret model, bro, it ain't happening. It ain't happening. I don't care how confident podcast, you're not happening. uh if I step to a girl who's clearly out of my league, I'm not she's not going to be like, "Well, for example, if I'm offering her on a silver platter sex, she's like, "No, but like as a woman, if you offer a a guy who's more attractive than you on a silver platter, you offer him sex, right? He's g he might take that opportunity." So women have at least limited sexual access to men outside their league. And so essentially uh it creates a completely different a massive dynamic. Yeah. No and I think I think you're you're absolutely right. There's nothing everything you said was absolutely correct. Um I but I think what what happens here Yes. I think online women and men have unrealistic expectations of what they can get and women have more access to those unrealistic expectations. Yeah. They get breadcrumbs. They get a taste of it. Yeah. They get a taste. They get a taste. Yeah. They get a And it's hard to go back to the room. I get what you're saying. I totally understand. I think there are certain people that chase that kind of thing, though. I think there are other women who, you know, maybe they're raised in a different environment. They're not chronically online. Um they they really do want someone to just sit on the couch and watch Netflix with, you know, and they want to go get in and out and like do that kind of stuff. So, I but I I I totally agree that maybe there's some misguidedness on like our expectations uh because of the internet. But I also think that part of the frustration that men feel is that imbalance in the sexual marketplace. And so men are frustrated because women do have access to that and they don't. And that frustrates them because they want access to those same women but they can't get them. And so there's a frustration that comes from that that I think what happens is online that starts to build as they continue to, you know, consume content that basically tells them that's all you should be is this cuz if you're not that, you're never going to get anybody. And I think that message is pounded into men's heads so much so that when I'm talking to them, I'm like, "It's not like that. I got to get you outside. I got to get you offline and talking to real people." And I know it's difficult. It's hard to approach a woman. But I I was I was getting my haircut for this podcast and I was getting my haircut and I was telling them I was coming on here and one of the girls was like, "Oh, I'm single, you know." And I was like, "Well, uh, you know, do guys ask you out?" She's like, "No." She was like, "And honestly, the next guy that asked me out, I'd probably say yes cuz he had the balls to do it." And I'm like, "Wow." You know, like, "Shout out to homie and OC. Like, hit up Camp uh haircut. You might you might get a date." Wait, you you have a female barber? No, no, no. She I have a male barber. She was in there. She was in there and I was talking to her. Uh she's one she worked there. Um so, yeah. Okay, that's my point. I'm going to uh let the rest of the chats come through, guys. Guys, $30 TTS. Final call. Final call. We're going to wrap up here in just a sec. Since you asked, your face, posture, physomy, voice, and even your vibe makes you unmasculine. You're a teeny tiny little bait cuck with fe wings. [ __ ] Your opinions just makes you we [ __ ] joyful, are you? Hey, Josh. Josh, do you hear this voice? You hear this luscious voice? You think that sounds not masculine, dude? What the [ __ ] What the [ __ ] Lucas donated $30. Brian dot. That's true. If her too thick, push-ups can be difficult, but I still do one arm push-ups and still rep out with legit pull-ups. Chat, I apologize for my cockiness/hubris. Lucas, no one's going to roast you, dude. I deserve it. No one's roasting Lucas because he's too big. Lucas donated $30 one/ Brian. I wish I can show my face on camera. I'm actually pretty polite in person. Unfortunately, there are a lot of pronoun in the email signature block people in my firm's HR department. I would have to got to continue. Lucas donated $30. Thank you, man. Coned, I would have to pull a at home, i.e. hide my face or blur it on camera. Otherwise, pretty good chance I'd be hitting the bread line afterwards. It's NYC after all. We have a V for vendetta mask that you could wear. Or if honestly, Lucas, if you want, just come kick it. Spart kick it behind the scenes. You don't even have to come on camera. Uh, thank you, Josh. Josh donated $30. All your opinions have meant nothing. Be a man and stop being a clown. You won't see it in others. Only way you'll understand is when it happens to you. You probably got no guy friendss either. I do have guy friends. That That hurts though. That hurts, man. God, Duran Dolls, dude, I haven't seen you in a while. Donated $30. Thank you so much. Being handsome gets your foot in the door, which leads to success, which builds confidence. Just tell guys to be more confident, bro. I don't know why more men didn't think of that. I I have something on this. I I hear what you're saying. I think looks help you helps you feel confident, but I think confidence can be built in other ways. For example, just having a belief in yourself that maybe, hey, I don't have all the answers, but I'm going to come do it anyway. That's confidence. Or you build confidence by successfully doing things over time beyond dating. just, hey, I tried to learn this how to ride a motorcycle and now I ride a motorcycle. That builds confidence. Learning new skills that builds confidence. I don't think it's just looks. Looks help, but there's other ways to build confidence. All right, we got ghost here. Thank you, Duran. Good to see you. Logistics donated $30. BTW, my kid I took custody of at 1.5 months old from a girl I broke up with for lying about birth control. Dated her for a week. Men abandoning is often avoiding the persecution in court. Ghost. Yeah, I have heard reports like uh so for example, a guy will uh really want to fight for his children and then he'll go talk to uh a family law attorney. Yeah. And the family law attorney does not have like a good uh prediction for how it's going to go and that men face certain uh challenges when it comes to uh custody disputes and this sort of thing. And so a lot of men just I mean they're like man I'm going to spend all this money with a really low chance of getting a positive outcome. One of the other things that often frequently happens, and I don't know if this is the case for Ghost, I don't recall his points, is, and I'm not saying all women do this, but this is actually, and I think this is something that's been studied, but uh the incidence of false accusations once a custody dispute has been initiated and if the man challenges the uh dispute over custody, um it's it's frequently seen more so uh almost exclusively on the women's part for various accusations to manifest themsel out of the ether uh once the man starts uh fighting for custody. For example, uh there will be accusations of uh verbal abuse. There'll be accusations of emotional abuse. There'll be accusations of physical abuse towards the towards the woman. But then if uh if the woman doesn't get her will, there will be further accusations that are even more sinister and malevolent. She'll start accusing the man of abusing the child, physically abusing the child, and I think the worst sexual uh well the yeah of the child. And um these manifest as attempts at leveraging uh these sorts of accusations to either uh destroy the morale of men who are attempting to uh fight for custody of their children. Yeah. uh or to paint a picture of the man as being uh essentially uh well abusive and precluding him from getting any degree of custody. Uh and I'm not look there are genuine instances of abuse, but this is seen and uh Lucas is an attorney. I don't know if you he can weigh in on this and I don't know if this is his area of practice with uh well I don't think it's his area of practice family law but this is seen frequently in custody dispute situations which tend to end up when there's a mutual uh custody dispute often times are very very uh what's the term for like with a legal thing if it's uh contentious very contentious very get very nasty and when people are fighting over their children which I think is really unfort fortunate. Uh often times in furtherance of if if it's expedient to throw out the false accusation in the hopes of either uh making the court believe that these abuses are real or demoralizing the the man the the man to uh cease their his his pursuit of custody. Uh it's it it's actually effective sadly. I bet. I bet. I bet it I I I Okay, assuming the instances are false, of course. I'm sure there instances where it's true, but assuming this is being completely fabricated. Yeah, that can totally be used against men because I'm sure there's a bias that that happened or they're going to believe the woman, you know, because of this, you know, and that's horrible. That shouldn't be done. Um I I I abhore anybody who tries to keep a good father from their kids. I think that's horrible. I think that's one of the worst things you could possibly do. Keeping bad fathers away from kids. I'm okay with keeping good fathers away. That's that's evil in my opinion. Yeah. Yeah. Um and I don't know if that's a ghost situation, but uh there was like I think two separate guys who sent in messages who were saying they had like these just catastrophic like months or even year-long custody disputes. It's just it's you know what's actually interesting is uh I I actually sat in uh I was like preparing for a small claims case I was dealing with and I just went to the courthouse and I sat in uh and uh in one of the these court proceedings and I watched like three separate uh divorce slash uh child custody child support and it's it's really sadly dude it's like sad to see these two people they once loved each There's children involved and the relationship's just completely destroyed. It's really sad. It's sad as hell. And uh yeah, it's uh it's horrible for everybody. You had criticisms as it relates to like my anti-marriage position. And like honestly, I this might seem like kind of doomer black pill, but I do think it's worth it for men to just to just go make an informed decision. just go and watch family law proceedings for an hour or two and just be you gotta be I'm not saying well maybe don't get married but at least go into it knowing that in the event of a divorce that's how it could be. So one just you got to pick you got to make sure you pick the right woman. Absolutely. You don't want to be dealing with a woman that's going to be like any sort of It's tough though. Even some women switch up so you can't even really know. But you got to just make sure you got to vet you got to vet the woman properly. Even then, man, [ __ ] It's complicated. Whatever. I'm going to let the rest of the chats come through. Oh my god. Intel Wild donated $29.99. Did this one come through already? This has a micro kit. No, it's huge. It's gargantuan word.

Uh, we have uh here I'll wait for Lucas to finish this. Michael G. Raph, you're a kind-hearted good man who's makes you a target in secular capitalism. You need to join the church and you can thrive. Next debate, you'll be Andrew teaching you how to accept Jesus. Uh, thanks for the compliment, Michael. I do try to be kind and good-hearted. Um, I am thriving, though. I got to say I love I do love my life. All right. And then we have these final messages here from Lucas. Lucas donated $30. Thank you, man. One/Brian James Ston talks about this a lot. Women fight hard for custody. BC, there is child support dollar at play. The child support money is typically not specifically earmarked for the kids. So, it can, you know, really quick, I'm going to let the rest of viewers come through there. there. This is actually a men's rights position. In the same way with like food stamps and SNAP benefits, like food benefits, uh you can only like they give you a card. You can only spend it on food. Yeah. Uh you can't like go buy like I don't know like alcohol. You can't go and buy like um electronic like it it will only work with food. And I think there could be something else implemented with child support where it has to be spent on something. It could get a little complicated though if like part of it is like helping out with rent, but like child support should go towards the child. It should go towards child expense, like child support related expenses. It should you shouldn't be able to get your nails done if there's like excess money from the child support. So I think I I I think everyone can agree with that. Are there people that don't? Are there people that think otherwise? Cuz I feel like that's pretty reasonable. Yeah. Well, but there's not currently like like a system for that. There's not a system in place for that. It's just like here's $2,000 or here's however much money it is. You can really spend it on anything you want. So Lucas donated $30 countered so the mother can use the child support dollar for whatever since it's never audited. Also, family law is court of equity, so false allegations are typically handled as per the judge's discretion. Lucas donated $30. What's that? Three/ not pursuant to a law standard of proof. Also, officer Tatum has often discussed the weaponization of false TV allegations. Yo, Jay, bench £400. You got me, bro. What? What is uh court of equity? What does that mean? Never heard that. 04 donated $30. Brian lost my ex-wife to substance abuse and bipolar disorder. Came out of the blue. Even if you think you picked the one, it can change overnight. It cost her the marriage and her life. I'm sorry, buddy. That's That's hard, man. Wait, you lost her as in she? It sounds like it. It sounds like it cost her life. You lost her like you got divorced. I think you said it cost her life. I don't know. Oh, and she Okay. Oh my god, I'm so toaster brain. And her life. Okay, that's hard, man. I didn't see that part. Sorry to hear that, man. Um, damn. It takes a lot of bravery to to engage in relationships cuz they really can go bad. I mean, that's that that's the reality. They can go real bad. And I'm really sorry to hear it went that way. That's Yeah. I mean, that's the tough thing, too, is like you think you know somebody, but people change, circumstances change. I don't think most people go into relationships or specifically marriage like like anticipating that there's going to be a divorce. Like they're probably not like thinking like this is going to happen, but they probably think this is the love of my life, right? And and it's devastating if it if it goes the other way. It's devastating because you really do believe in this thing. So yeah, I I look I I don't want to belittle men trying to date because it is scary as [ __ ] And I think that's why women appreciate the courage often because it is a brave thing to do to go talk to women. And I I mean I from my own experience uh I've actually dated some pretty wonderful women. Uh, but there was one girl in particular I dated who she had uh borderline personality disorder, BPD, and uh I mean honestly there were some I was young looking back there's some signs pretty early on. There were some signs early on that I probably could have tuned into, but I was young and naive and didn't have much relationship experience, but uh like uh definitely people, you know, like that relationship from how it started to like it changed a lot completely different. It was very different. But even like people who don't have any sort of uh like personality disorders or whatever, [ __ ] can change. Absolutely. And I think one of the things though, at least as it relates to marriage, which is one of the things men should potentially look out for, is I think once you're married, I think the woman has more has leverage because if if you're the bread winner, if you're the bread winner as the guy and you're getting into alimony territory. Yeah. Then it's like she's kind of got you by the balls. It she's got you by the balls. It can be, but I I I could be wrong, but I think again, I might have been wrong about some of my stats, but I believe only 10% of marriages end up with alimony payments. I think I think it's something along those lines. Yeah, I don't know what the statist statistics are on it. Obviously, if you've been married for a short time, my understanding is if it's below a certain threshold, you'll pay alimony for a duration that's proportionate to the length of uh you know, the marriage. It's not like I don't think it's you've been married for 3 years, you pay alimony for 3 years. I think it's maybe I don't know. It's different in different jur jurisdictions. Maybe it's half. I think in California it's either after eight or 10 years, then there's the it's potentially life lifetime alimony. That's kind of ridiculous. But well, I personally believe, you know, if you're really worried about if you really have a lot of assets and finances and you're worried about alimony, I mean, if you know, I think a woman can understand a prenup prenup. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Yeah. that there's concerns with prenups too. They can be Yeah, prenups can be challenged. Oh. Uh yeah, they prenups can be challenged. Sometimes they can be deemed uninforceable. Interesting. And then it can often times it can I think Lucas, correct me if I'm wrong, it only applies to that which occurs uh or it can only exclude that like assets or money that existed prior to the marriage, but anything earned during the marriage. I I don't think I I think legally you could still exclude things during the marriage. I think I could be wrong, but I think cuz uh yeah, but we do have to wrap the show.
