welcome to a special debate edition of the whatever podcast I'm your host and moderator Brian Atlas a few quick Ado I'm joined today by Destiny famous internet personality live streamer and political commentator joining him is Jasmine Jafar the self described ho lawyer she does uh porn and only fans we have Lyla Rose she's the founder and president of the prolife organization live action and Trent horn Trent earned master degrees in the fields of theology philosophy and bioethics Trent is an Adjunct professor of apologetics at Holy Apostles college and he is the author of nine books welcome everybody thank you Brian so uh we originally planned to have a proper debate moderator who was going to join us uh unfortunately there was emergency and they couldn't make it so this is going to be a very less a fair when it comes to the moderation for the most part I'm just going to let you guys talk the topic of today's debate is sex work bad for society and I think a good jumping off point if you can each one by one summarize your position on this topic starting with Destiny and then Jasmine and then Lyla and then Trent also we ought to Define for each other on the audience what is meant by the term sex work I mean sex work strikes me as a sort of nebulous vague term meaning anything from taking non-nude lingerie photos all the way to selling $5 in the backlog of a 7-Eleven so uh go ahead start with you Destiny yeah I think when we ask if uh sex work is good or bad for society I think it's important to recognize that there are forms of entertainment that we can consume that aren't necessarily like good but they don't necessarily do a bad um it's just a matter of whether or not consuming some things for entertainment purposes is like a thing we want to defend in society I think broadly speaking we do we would say that like video games for instance aren't necessarily good but I don't know if we would call them bad as long as they're enjoyed in an appropriate environment with an appropriate level of consumption um so I think as long as we say that people want to buy sex work and people want to sell sex work and if it can be done so in a way that is safe to both parties and we can't see any like clear or obvious damage to society then I think that that transaction ought to be protected and I think I would say like all other forms of entertainment we would say it's a good thing in society yeah so I think uh sex is a drive everybody has and there's always going to be a demand for consensual sexual services and there's always going to be people who are willing to supply it I think a society that grants its citizens they in civil liberties and freedoms like the the ability like sexual autonomy and the freedom to control their own sex lives is better for society um and I don't think adding money into that should really change anything um I think anytime we're addressing whether something is good for society we have to think of how society would look if we were to try to come in and remove that thing um and I think for one there isn't at least compelling evidence that sex work or porn or any of these things are harmful enough that we should try to do that especially if we compare it to other things that we allow and also um the times that people have tried to come in and restrict those things um haven't shown to be very successful let's start with okay and apologies for any coughing I've had a cough for three weeks and it still isn't going away but anyways thanks for um your patience with me if I start to cough I think that sex is an amazing and beautiful thing and it has a design to it uh it has a purpose to it and I think to ignore that design is to live in an unreality that brings harm to oneself and other people and sex can do two beautiful things it can create intimacy and bonding and pleasure which is amazing between two people and it can also bring life into the world and I think there's a ton of social data that shows that when you divorce sex from its meaning and you treat it like it's meaninglessness like like it has no meaning a hedonistic view of sex leads to a lot of social ills and harm it's destructive to the people that behave as if it's meaningless and it's also destructive to people that um are also hit by the consequences of that behavior like a spouse in a marriage whose partner is using porn and they're deeply unhappy or the children of that marriage or um you know promoting sex work leading to uh sexual behaviors that can come bring life into the world and then you have this life that uh doesn't have committed parents who are going to raise them and and love them so I think we have to live in reality that sex has meaning it has consequences it's a beautiful and powerful thing and a society that orders itself self to recognize that meaning um is going to be a healthier happier society and that's what I want for everyone yeah I would say that excuse me see I'm the one coughing now I took it from you sorry sex is a very important thing I think everybody nearly everybody agrees that sex is something that's really important but the problem that I have with sex work and that's a term actually that I don't consider legitimate people other people want to use it that's fine uh but I don't think that sex work exists any more than friend work exists sex is more than just a biological process or an activity between people when sex is reduced to hedonistic in its meaning that sex is an activity that one engages in for pleasure that does lead to bad things in society it leads to further degrading sexual acts like when we look at popular forms of pornography on the internet based in violence degradation uh scatological urine feces uh rape play that the human brain uh is rewired by seeing this kind of stuff and this isn't just stuff on the margins either uh to look at what sex work does if it takes sex and drains it of its meaning to make it hedonistic we also lose the principles that we need to show that other depraved or disordered forms of sexuality are wrong or bad um I like Destiny what you said about video games but if I had to make a video game analogy I think most video games are actually good or neutral there's a few outliers like let's say they had Call of Duty a few back in 2009 there was the level no Russian where you could go around and you could shoot innocent people at an airport and that was very controversial and most video games are not like that but if video games were like porn some of the most popular games that people search for would have degrading acts of violence in it towards you know just innocent people not zombies I think people would see that that's very bad for the human person to degrade themselves in that way so so I am concerned that pornography and prostitution uh degrade sex from having a very important meaning and expression of love between person persons and leads to an exploitation and problems in society if it's just a heathenistic view that's our that's my view those are opening all right good debate guys but I do think it's important that we to Define that obviously like we said the term sex work is pretty broad here I would say I Define it into pornography and prostitution with a gray area obviously in between it's kind of hard to determine but mostly this just involves monetizing the arousal of other people the sexual arousal of other people so there you have to have be making money and your intention is to sexually arouse other people or bring them to climax you know obviously if you're engaged in a sex act gotcha before we real quick before we dive into this um I think there's two really different ways this conversation we go we can do both I think we should decide first do we want to talk about sex work through the lens of the teleology of what we think sex ought to be for or do we want to talk about like the impacts on society first I think both should be yeah but I think because they're both very very different arguments so do we want to focus on the first one of like what sex ought to be or I think we can talk about that because I think the big thing that's dividing us is that it is bad to misuse sex sex is very important thing and so if one misuses it this will tend to lead to all kinds of social problem natural consequences to the misuse or the abuse of sex and you can live in an unreality and sort of mitigate those natural consequences um but it only goes so far and there are going to be casualties and so like a question I have is you guys are saying like porn like has been so bad for society what are some of these outcomes you've seen since like the late ' 90s early 2000s when the internet you know became a thing you guys are saying porn is now making Society worse when in a lot of ways it seems like since the late two late 1990s and early 2000s we have less cases of sa less child abuse abortion rates are down like 41% I'm not saying this is because of porn but it doesn't seem like porn has turned everyone into these violent that people are having less sex we have less teen pregnancies all of that stuff so what well I I dispute the claim that sexual assault can we say that or we just say cessi that's fine yeah okay that's I dispute the claim that sexual that porn leads directly to a reduction in sexual assault we have to be careful to not do um after therefore because of um that porn becomes more prevalent what happens after that if you look at statistics of sexual assault they have been declining since the 1990s but since 2012 they have dramatically increased anyone who's watching this just Google uh rape United States 1990 to 2022 or rape UK sorry grape uh UK uh from 2000 so from 2002 to 2022 and you see a dramatic rise like in the UK it's like from goes from 60,000 reported cases to 130,000 reported cases from 2012 to 2017 what's driving that wait can I ask real quick actually cuz I just looked these up and I noticed that what you said is exactly right from 1992 they fall until 2012 and then they Spike they Spike what happened in 2013 wasn't 2013 the start of the me to movement me2 movement started in 201 17 with the list 2017 yeah okay got you I I I thought about that too that that might be now I think that when we talk about what causes things to happen in society it's rarely ever one thing because people are complex so like why also there's a difficulty in assessing how many rapes occur like it's not as hard to figure out how many murders occur because you just count the dead bodies or how many cars are stolen you count the cars that are taken but rap many rapes are not processed uted or they're not reported or but I think the number of allegations I do want to hear L your thoughts on that we see it going up I think that one element that would make sense to see that drive from the 2010s is that online pornography had a huge boost during this time period that we have PornHub was started in 2007 and it explodes going through 2012 2015 on and if you're wondering like the things that I'm concerned about you look at like PornHub from 2012 to like 2020 what are the most popular terms being searched most popular terms are Teen Mom stepmom this is not just like your vanilla pornography people are looking for though I find it suspicious that PornHub isn't reporting the teen search anymore uh so I think that that could be a part in there of that further degradation of sexuality during that time period I think that's a a very significant point that you just raised about pornub in the most popular Search terms the reality is child sexual assault material has proliferated in recent years with the rise of more internet uh spread of pornography and the ease of use of the spread of pornography um pornography that is violent is increasing pornography pornography that involves um minors is increasing uh so there's that world of that you know people involved and that usually those that have a you know you can use the word Addiction or compulsion around pornography there's a need for it to be increasingly Intense or violent or disordered in the sexual acts that are being portrayed for them to find it fulfilling and so they have to continue on this like porn use um Journey that they're on and it leads to many other victims left in the wake of it like children but another side of it too is the relational side for people that are trying to make families because I think civilization is built on families families is where what we're born into it's where we find our greatest meaning and worth um how we're formed as kids you know how we become good citizens one day and how we discover love for the first time and today you know around 20% of couples report that they experienced conflict because of porn use of one of the partners like this is a significant thing afflicting a lot of relationships and um one of the top rated things in divorce um settlements are the porn use of one of the partners so it's really damaging and I think the life experience of many people I'm sure are listening to this podcast right now they know people everyone knows someone who's been hurt by pornography so it's it's really um I don't think the pleasure of orgasm B es out the the cons so the data I'm sure you guys when you were looking at porn it's very mixed big medical consensus is that like this addiction and all that's not a thing when it comes to couples it seems like when the couples are on the same page that it doesn't lead to negative impacts it leads to that when there's one couple what do you mean by on the same page like when both like if uh like in a in a couple if they don't care if the other person watches porn which is a lot of couples then it doesn't seem to have these kind of negative do you think that's the majority I think it's a lot of people do you think the majority majority of couples the the wife or the girlfriend doesn't mind that's really hard to tell the majority of people I know it's like that maybe the majority of people he knows and the majority of people you know it's the opposite so I don't know I do think in general people don't see viewing pornography as like cheating do you think the majority of people think that cheating is wrong though or even asking can I havea is wrong because it violates your boundaries but if that's not violating your boundaries which it's not for a lot of people then it doesn't seem to be having these negative that that same do you think a majority wives would think that it's wrong for a husband to even ask if he should be allowed to cheat that's not cheating is about violating boundaries but if he asked is it okay if I watch porn when we're not together a lot of wives girlfriends would say yes but do you think a lot of the girl wives and girlfriends saying yes are saying yes CU they're really chill about it it's not a big deal we don't care or they're saying yes because Society is telling them you should say yes I was say about the boundaries is is it okay for a husband to ask hey can we renegotiate these boundaries yeah of course it's it's always so there's nothing wrong with a husband saying Hey cuz I think many people that would would wives girlfriends lots of you would say no that's wrong that you would even ask that's that's just not okay to do you don't ask for something like that some people and I think for some people that's not the case I don't know exactly percentages but the majority like exactly if I'm talking about like people I know this all I have anecdotal out EV inst andless there's some study done on this is a lot of people like don't care so I think there's a bit of a myth of this idea that well if my boundary is that it's okay to share you sexually with someone else even though we're in a supposedly committed relationship I think there's a mythology that as long as there's consent between the two adults then it's okay for one or both to cheat as long as they know and they're okay you're using the word cheat when we're not talking about cheating I'm saying not have sexual Fidelity so have sexual experiences relationships with other people whether that's through a screen or in life in in real life and you know there are studies that show um you know I have one right here that shows that married people who more frequently view porn even if it's together even if it's like we're consenting this is a thing we're doing together are more likely to experience marital dissatisfaction down the line than couples that do not look at porn together so pornography has a pernicious effect even on consenting couples who are saying we're doing this together it's so great that was that was a longitudinal study based on the social science survey with 2000 people it's not just like a correlative effect so even if even if in our minds we rationalize and we live in the unreality of this is not affecting me I can have this open marriage or I can have this open relationship and my partner can look at porn or have another sexual relationship it still affects you in the real world and it still affects your long-term um potential for happiness and Fidelity and not just Fidelity but happiness and um fulfillment in the relationship and so you can we can tell ourselves a theory or a myth of like hey it's going to be okay I'm cool with this but in reality it doesn't work that way in the long run but see like with a lot of this I'm not sure if you guys were really frust ated looking up this stuff too cuz so many studies conflict when it comes to porn and viewing and like women you view pornography report higher sexual satisfaction when they view it with a partner in fact the data on women a lot of why would that be Jasmine why would that be what do you mean why would that be well you just said women report higher satisfaction if the porn is being viewed with a partner because at least they feel like I'm not being 100% cheated on in this moment no I don't I think you're just putting your framework on everybody else like I'm a woman too I don't care if my partner watches porn it's not just me trying to satisfy him it's not just me being like and I think a lot of people you have to separate being like being with another partner physically versus porn because I think the numbers there would be vastly different on who's okay if their partner when they're not around is watching porn versus who's okay with them sleeping with another person in real life I think you're going to get widely different opinions there from Girlfriends wives women on whether that's okay or not I would say when we look at the studies like for example in 2023 angle camp at all published a study in the Journal of sex and marital therapy and it did a quantitative analysis and the most common themes among couples where the man views pornography is that the woman is glad that he told it that he talked about it openly uh but disapproves or is allowing the husband to look at pornography but does not want to hear about it so I think you would say that only a minority of women are positively in favor of this it's either negative or ambivalent well and I think the point is the the longitudinal study you mentioned and I mentioned is that even though that say they're in favor of it and are like watching it as a couple have worse outcomes down the line and I think that's part of the you know the point here is that even if you you like you're you're in a very unique situation you're making your living doing this thing right and so in your mind of course it's going to be great I know you're going to defend it and say it's going to be great but the reality is even people that are defending it or saying it's fine in my marriage down the line don't have the best outcome also to be fair too real quick cuz you talked career you guys are both ideologically you could never change your on this complely not true arious all the studies I chose to be Catholic and I can choose to reject my faith sure but if like the research Catholic yeah but she could also change her career my point is that even guys just one at a time we can change our mind on empirical questions about whether a majority of people feel satisfaction in something you can't use a a a social science survey to determine whether something is moral or immoral pushing back on the claim that like because it's her job she has to defend it speaking to outcomes though because what I'm trying to explain here is not my point here is that you can say and one can say I'm comfortable with this I'm fine with this it's okay in my marriage or my relationship but my point is the social data shows that people who are comfortable with open relationships or pornography in their relationship have worse outcomes down the line well the people have the worst sorry people have the worst outcomes when it comes to viewing pornography are people who have moral in congruence with it that's what all there's been huge meta analysis where they looked at the number one determinant or the number one predictor of having bad experiences with porn or quote unquote porn addiction which the medical consensus is is not a thing is moral in congruence and being religious is one of the biggest predictors of that so I agree porn is really bad for Catholics I just don't agree that it's bad for everybody but my point here is that even people who find a way to morally rationalize theuse pornography or whatever it is down the line at large outcomes are worse for open marriages that kind of argument is like saying well gambling addiction isn't really real because the people who are most upset about gambling are only the people who are upset about losing money but people who don't care about losing money well they're not really that psychologically disturbed about gambling a lot but maybe they should be worried about that just like people should be worried about what porn is doing to them when it desensitizes their brain and it makes them think that I need more and more hits and more and more disturbing pornography to get off but the difference is that with um and that's why the dsm5 accepts gambling they've said multiple times they've rejected porn multiple times because you can't make a link to how much people VI they include hypersexuality under impulse control dsm5 that's in the world uh Health Organization they it's compulsion but not an addiction but is a compulsion a good thing jine well hypersexuality is a compulsion to masturbate or is it a compulsion to have sexual experiences it's I mean either way is a compulsion that you are at the mercy of and that often brings a lot of harm suffering no but I don't see I don't see the difference there that if you can be in a situation where I I think gambling and porn they're very similar in their compulsivity that there are lots of people who can gamble I gamble and I didn't lose the house lots of people can gamble but there's a subset when they gamble it turns their brain on too much and they need to get more and more highs from it so they gamble more and more and more and just even seeing the slot machine it does something to their brain and they're in a situation where I don't want to be gambling I feel bad I don't want to be doing this but they just can't stop similar things with porn there's lots of people who watch porn and they don't turn into Maniacs or anything like that but there's a subset where it lights up their brains and they know I don't want to be doing this I know it's just killing my marriage my wife feels awful knowing that I go and look at this stuff I feel bad but I can't stop don't those seem like similar levels of compulsion it it may seem that way but the scientific consensus right the dsm5 statement is that other excessive behavioral patterns such as Internet gaming have also been described but the research on these and other behavioral syndromes is less clear they get akin to exercise addiction shopping addiction and sex addiction the data is just not there that it affects you the way gambling does that's not me saying it that's what the scient the the dsm5 is not an infallible Bible for everyone you have other studies for example love at all published a series a study on the neuroscientific foundation of pornography addiction and that was a 2015 article and they a a meta analysis and they do link it to other addictions and other compulsions so I I think if people just look at it you just take a a bird's eye view the person who feels bad gambling and can't stop the person who feels bad shopping and can't stop and the person who looks at porn or sees prostitutes and feels bad and can't stop it all seems pretty similar to me the difference is that with porn they've done multiple studies where it's like somebody who has positive attitudes toward it versus someone who has negative attitudes toward it they're watching the same amount and they're having the same you they shortterm those are short-term studies though but it's but the point is you can tell yourself again you can live in unreality and tell yourself you know this sexual act of infidelity I know you don't call it infidelity cuz someone consented to it but me going and you know being polyamorous or me going in having multiple sexual experiences outside of my marriage or my relationship or me going in looking at pornography or using pornography you can tell yourself and experience short-term pleasure you absolutely I think a lot of wives would say would say that if if their husband is chatting with you on a live cam they would say that's cheating you think a lot of wives would feel that way you don't know how many wives find me for their husbands on also wait hold on yeah when we when we talk about like cheating or murder when we talk about like murder murder is clearly unjustified killing right what are we talk about murder I'm just saying that the word murder means unjustified killing it's baked into there's such thing as a Justified murder when you use the word cheating then you're begging the question of course it's wrong but the question is whether or not these behaviors can be engaged in like consensual ways so to say like oh well us back to what is sex for that might maybe that's fine yeah we can go back wait I'm just yeah um I'm just saying that you can't just keep calling it cheating over and over and over again because you're begging the question you're loading in with the word cheating is baked into this idea that a VI that a boundar is being violated or that non-consensual activity is happening and that might be your position or that might be your opinion but you can't have that perspective on two other people's boundaries if they say well in our relationship we're allowed to watch porn it it's inappropriate for you to call that a different point in response to Jasmine no no hold on I'm just being clear because Jasmine counter contradicted that point and then you tried to explain why well actually it is always infidelity when infidelity again has baked into it that tautologically trying to Define away the argument which is whether or not you can engage in these behav in a healthy way you're well obviously you can't because it's infidelity it's like well you're begging the question so if we're going to talk about the behaviors themselves we can but you can't call them all def the terms as you please I think my point here with hold on what I'm defining as I please we all agree that that's what those words mean every single person watching infidelity and cheating means that you are doing something in contradiction to what your partner wants we all agree with that and we all agree those are specific to sexual behavior everybody here agrees that Infidel and cheating is bad right yeah okay so we all agree with that so then so then why like well this is cheating we already agree that that's bad age to disagree on the point that yes I think it is infidelity or cheating to have sex outside of your two people are in a relationship and they say that hey it's okay if we watch porn you think they're still cheating on each other that is being unfaithful to each other yes okay so so she has a different view on different definition I guess and we can agree to disagree on that at this point but my larger point that I was trying to make with you Jasmine or you know kind of get to the bottom of was yes you can say I'm feeling great about this I just had an orgasm it feels great I'm so happy with this you know pornog pornography I just consumed or this you know webcam person I just spoke with or whatever or had this you know relationship with or whatever it is um but in the long term these things don't serve the person or Society so we can we can actually agree with you that Hedonism feels good in the moment like I don't think Trent would even disagree at least for the person taking part in the Hedonism they might feel sick deep in their conscience but I think in the moment physically they're going to feel good and that's the temptation of Hedonism right it's like it feels good of course I'm going to do it that's not true I mean women who view pornography report higher sexual satisfaction improv communication about sex with their part greater comfort with sexual well greater comfort with their own sexual orientation more frequent and higher quality sex easier Time study following there's multiple studies almost all the data on women in pornography in the old days it used to give them negative body image issues but since like people like me you know you're welcome or like more amateur porns started coming out actually women report see feeling better about their bodies there's a huge study about women feeling much better about their vulvas now because there seeing different types of Volvos represented in so you think pornographic accounts online like there's a lot of Instagram accounts for example that are kind of some softcore pornography are making women at large and young girls at large feel good about their bodies pornography there's studies about pornography and women who view pornography because a lot of women watch like amateur porn more so than the mainstream Studio porn now and you're seeing all different kinds of body types so that study that was done on women who now feel like oh I actually feel better about my vvo I feel better about my body when we compare that to women who viewed porn in the past when Studio porn was the only kind of porn out we're seeing a big difference yeah I mean at large sexual objectification of women online and major who viewsn body parts has been detrimental to young girls men view porn more but women also do view it sure I don't I don't disagree with that but I think we we just still need to go back to just the idea of our my argument I think be our argument that why pornography and prostitution is bad for society is that it encourages this false view about what sex is for that leads to all of these kinds of bad consequences also wait real quick can I run through something I'm taking notes on okay okay so real quick on just like a from top to bottom so well why don't we go back and forth yeah sure yeah yeah we can yeah I just want a chance to go back and forth in some I heard a lot of points I haven't been able to jump in a lot of these um on the first one so in 2013 the FBI redefined rape to include all forms of penetration on somebody including like digital penetration so that largely explains like the huge gap in in numbers that I don't know if you were trying to imply that in 2013 there was a spike that happened due to pornography or due to some other reason I'm saying I'm saying it's certainly plausible it's a part of it I don't and you don't have enough evidence to say that that explains all of the increase no but there was a massive redefinition it also wouldn't explain the increase at the same time in England and you I don't know about the increase in England I don't know about the increase in England but I feel like if the numbers dramatically jumped in 2013 it's strange that you didn't search for the answer for why they jumped and just assumed because it fits The Narrative of it must be pornography whatever when a redefining of when a redefining of rape would be a really big reason why the numbers might change for instance if you're familiar with Sweden's uh sexual assault statistics relating to immigration everything like the Swedish redefinition of a lot of these crimes is a reason why some of these numbers jump so I think anytime you see who Chum the data I think if you're inquisitive you'll usually ask like oh well I wonder why the DAT changed but there's also been meta analysis of porn consumption that shows that um many studies that show the link between porn use and keep in mind a lot of porn today some studies say 88% of porn today involves violence or aggressive acts I don't lit when you say violence or aggressive acts what does that mean um it involves you know I mean the extreme simulation of no you said 88% I watch a lot of porn I don't know how much porn is violent or aggressive I'm just curious what counts as an aggressive act 88% of porn as aggressive causing uh pain or or discomfort to the um person that's be being involved in the sexual act so that's one that was that was a 2010 study another one that was published by veric gray 2021 in the British Journal of criminology said that it put it at 1 in8 had acts of violence that would be considered violence like under you know things like uh like uh B for example binding four Limbs and penetration gagging I the one and one women are the ones that are disproportionately actually seeking that stuff out so is that also just to police people they also disproportionately I would say wait hold on just a sec Destiny you wanted to go and then LED so I could believe the one and8 number the 8 % there's no chance that that's true that's not of all pornography it's of the 300 most common sure I'm just saying 88% of all pornography being violent unless you're defining like oral sexist violent there's no shot that the number is that high that's just it's of the most popular that's why on that's why on PornHub you're having teens and then you're having you know step you know step parents involved or stepmom involved I think uhre I think urinating urinating and ejaculating on somebody's face I think that's violent and degrading I understand what you're saying but to the vast majority of normal human beings urinating on somebody's face is far different than ejaculating on somebody's face Maybe in the Catholic world that's those are similar things but in the Ordinary World those are two completely totally separate acts I think most I think most people in the regular world who don't would consider that utterly degrading those I'm saying those two things are different if you want to classify both them as degrading that's fine why why are they different because I don't know how much into detail but urinating on somebody's face the Kink of water sports is considered to be more extreme there's far fewer people that are into it and you're involving nonsexual fluids now in like a sexual sense that's just considered a more hardcore type of why if anything urine is probably a more sterile liquid and just because fewer people do it doesn't mean it's more extreme I'm sure there's fewer people who do like Star Trek cosplay porn but that doesn't mean it's more extreme than others just because it's minority I think that's just you're probably consider more extreme it's not an intuition it's because generally the further you get away from things that are uh less directly involved with sex and then like the more uncomfortable those things tend to make people the more we would classify those things as being kind of like extreme I think it's like a I mean I don't know if I'm sure we could have a huge debate on like is this is porn considered extreme or is it just like a hardcore Kang we can get into I'm just saying in general if you look the number of people into a kink like water sports or you mentioned like skatology like stuff like that versus you're you're talking about is that just urinating on others or is it other other urinating on people or any I think anything involving people I'm not sure I don't okay maybe Brian can fill us in more on because I like because that that's just euphemism I enjoy water sports I don't enjoy that well that's what it's called I don't care you know I mean people can come up with all this sort this sort of stuff to smooth over you know what is no trying I'm just trying to give an accurate accounting of what of how you refer these things if you're looking them up trying to find go ahead did you want to ask anything else I have question I reject this idea of like well as pornography increases uh child sex material increases therefore that's a fact though that's fine that it's a fact but what I notice is often times with porn to try to refute like the Central Point people will point to a negative outcome that might be increasing and pretend that that count as a reputation of the single point a statement that I can make that's not what we did though Destiny that's exactly what you're doing you're saying that as pornography increases child sexual sexual material might increase which means it's an attack against pornography what I would say is it's a form of pornography let me finish my statement what I would say it is a form of pornography literally the increase of anything involving say children playing video games necessarily increases the exposure of them to people looking to abuse children that doesn't necessarily mean that online video games or children playing online video games are bad it just means you have to control for the negative outcome of people abusing people playing online video games same thing with pornography it's not an argument against pornography if some people might abuse it in a way there might be some people that actually record actual sexual assault that's not an argument against pornography it's an argument against people doing that bad thing it is an argument of the most commonly searched for terms are things like teen barely legal and they're constantly searched over and over as the most popular thing which people aren't doing with like video here here's the theory that I that I think that the social data proves very clearly and the this is the this is the point that when we disorder sex when we divorce sex from love Fidelity commitment family you know like the the whole project of marriage I'm going to you know sex can bring life into the world if we do bring a life into the world we're going to stick together love each other build a family together when you take sex out of that context out of the context of love and marriage and you put it in the context of my my goal my orgasm what I want right um at whatever cost I can pay provided someone else consents right it's not just I think that person that will suffer and the other people engaged directly in that that will suffer but it is children and so you said well yes okay there's a proliferation of child sexual assault material yeah yeah but that's not saying porn is responsible for that that is a form of the porn that's being created and consumed at large in our society so to say that children are somehow unscathed by the pr pration of porn I think is to totally untrue Destiny and addition and in addition I'll just say one other thing the flip side of this we've debated on this before Trent has as well um sexual uh Hedonism at large in addition leads to what we have today which is abortion on demand you mentioned abortion rates are so low they're actually very high they're are nearly a million a year when porn with the wide um like availability of porn it's gone down a lot so I'm just kid you guys are saying oh my gosh there's all this violent stuff now I'm looking at the data there's nothing linking porn to increas violence is there actually a lot of studies that link the wide availability of pornography to less I have stud we we found that in the Czech Republic in Denmark three or four decades ago it was find a Playboy magazine or go to an adult video store today today porn is everywhere why are we not seeing this proliferation of violence and all these terrible things we're not those are all when there were just those Playboy magazines we had way more of that stuff than we do now with pornography wi so is your argument that we had less child sexual assault material child abuse has declined so you saying are you saying that child sexual assault material can be created without child abuse I'm saying that there that that like child abuse cases all of those have gone down I'm also saying STD rates have gone this is according to that's incorrect so incor incorrect okay what what data do you have so your your argument is that that the proliferation of porn somehow that has led to less child sexual AB led to I'm not saying causation your AR my argument here is that if porn became widely available and it's so violent and it's so terrible then how come we're not seeing those outcomes why is there proliferation of child sexual assault material on the internet and it increases every because we have the internet now we didn't have the internet before but when we since we've had the internet we've had less we've had less abortion less syphilis less gonorrhea less teen sex ta less teen birth rates have fallen 33% according to the CDC uh essay has declined and then so your argument is that child sexual assault material is not porn or what is your argument my argument I'm not even talking about sexual assault child sexual assault material my argument here is that when porn became widely available we didn't see an increase in violence in fact I have lots of studies here that show that once porn became widely available like for instance in the Czech Republic when did porn become widely available in the United States around the early 2000s that's what I read so I I think I I think I can understand the argument you're making but I don't think it Bears out for example with divorce rates as an example as I said earlier one of the the second highest most quoted thing when it comes to divorce today is the pornography use of one of the partners divorce rates have also gone down since then early overall they've gone up over the last not since the so this is my question since porn has become available they have not gone up they've actually gone down since the early 2000 one reason they go down is people are not to Mar but what I'm saying and I don't think they're choosing not I don't think they're not choosing to get married because porn is available but you have no link to that my question is but hold on I think it's a fact it is a fact that the sexual Revolution which took place in this country mid 20th century which opened the floodgates of pornography first with you know Playboy magazine and then later on with the internet which opened the floodgates to you know no fault divorce more divorce swinger Culture open marriages all of this stuff abortion all of this stuff that those all things those evil those social ills all mushroomed together and they still exist in large qual quantities in our society today together because when you treat sex just as orgasm or as something that as an adult I'm entitled to as long as I can sent and someone else is consenting and sex has no other morality around it you are opening the door and we have the doors wide open to divorce to abortion to uh a lot of the unhappiness that we're seeing in relationships social agrees with you but I'm pointing out that abortion rates have fallen 41% since the so but abortion rates since porn has been entered into the mainstream yes has gone down has gone up over the last 50 years dramatically but since no it became widely available in the late '90s so the CDC abortion rates have fallen 4 the 1990s it people look it up this is the CDC that's saying this but you don't think that porn is the only reason I don't think that but what my question to you is is that if it's such a terrible thing where are these terrible out I'm trying to say that I'm trying to say that porn whether it was the Playboy porn or it's the vastly available internet porn terrible do you think they're the same I think that they are part of the same problem which is divorcing meaning from sex and welcoming putting arms around hedonistic culture that breaks down families and breaks down marriages and I'm saying that in the last 50 years in this country we have seen unprecedented divorce unprecedented unprecedented abortion we've seen unprecedented the sexual revolutions harm talking about the sexual Revolution or porn because I'm not talking about 50 years I'm talking about since porn became widely available you guys are saying and all these terrible things teen mom porn so violent where are the outcomes that show that this is such an harm because I'm not seeing I have three studies here actually there's a lot of evidence that point has a cathartic effect do you think it's bad Jasmine that the average first stage of exposure to pornography is 11 years old I don't think that's ideal but I don't think not ask I said is it bad yeah I think it's bad but I'm not seeing that it's so bad that it's leading to such terrible outcomes because it's not where are these outcomes what happens when children are exp when children are exposed to pornography actually there's also a lot of conflicting data on that a lot of the data on this is really frustrating because it's really conflicting have studies here we're but Jasmine part of the reason for that is we're living in a social exp hold hold on one second I I want to know is it bad when 11-year-olds their first exposure to pornography I'm just saying that's a bad thing yeah it's a bad thing in the sense why is it why is it bad what does it do to them I don't it's like not they're not old enough their their prefrontal cortex isn't developed enough to be able to look at that and realize what's real what's not real how sex is supposed to go so I don't think porn is a great how how is sex supposed to go probably not like the right if you're on PornHub watching like eight people gang bang someone they're going to think that that is normal that's not normal not okay wa wait wait hold on wait okay I think when we talk about how sex supposed to go okay I think we have to build a constructive case for what are different ways that we can view sex um guys seem to be really happy to say that like sex ought to be this or societies destroyed sex or blah blah blah blah blah I think that you can posit a separate argument that sex is actually something that the body is capable of experiencing that is a lot of fun and we've evolved beyond the need to view sex as just a tool or a facility to pump out children and instead can view it as a way to bond with people or have fun or enjoy recreationally I think that we have the tools today to enjoy that because we got things to protect our cure STDs we've got ways to prevent pregnancies um we've got different types of birth controls I think that it's okay that Society has taken on a different view of sex just like we've taken on a different view of women working jobs or a different view of what kind of clothes can we wear because we have air conditioning or a different view of what are the hours that we can be awake where we can travel I think it's just natural that different things will evolve over time that will view different things yeah we can view things differently uh uh based on our way of engaging with them according to the go backer Institute for women that get abortions 50% of them in the month that they got pregnant were using contraception so when you kind of say well now we have these technologies that can somehow sort of blunt the con the natural consequences of what was this what was that supposed to refute so what's that supposed to refute is you're saying that we have all of these Powers now change the way we engage with sex the way we engage with was anything I said incorrect um I I think it's completely it's fully incorrect say do you think that contraception reduces the like no no let's one stat at a time no hold on get to ask my question I didn't even barely talk for two sentences and you wanted to cut me off with the thing about abortion so I'm going to ask you do you think contraception is effective at dramatically reducing the rates of of getting imp pregnant I think that at Large L contraception has led to the mindset a contraceptive I'm going to ask the same question again when you finish this it depends over time increases it actually leads to more abortion over time do you think that contraception is effective at preventing pregnancies it can in the short term but over time it leads to more abortion really do you have any evidence that somebody that is on so you're saying so you're saying you have a study right now that shows that somebody on contraception on average has more children over their lifetime than somebody that doesn't use contraception say okay so you don't have any evidence for that I don't I don't I don't well no you're giv me a lot of like socially constructed opinions you have data based on yours of how you think that sex should operate religious but I reject those things so obviously we know we know we are not making a case that sex ought to be done religiously or ought to be done in this particular way we are just saying that the view that that prostitution and pornography require which is that sex is just a hedonistic activity nobody why does it require that because it would be wrong if okay well what what what would you how would you answer the question it can have many purposes I think that when I go to a massage parlor I'm paying you know 80 bucks to get a massage that can just be a person give me massage with a partner having a partner rubbing your back or your neck that can feel like a lot more romantic just because I go to the massage Pro doesn't mean I devalue the experience with like a partner no what do you think it does earlier you used the phrase sex work isn't real because sex for hire doesn't make sense it's like a friend for hire what is a therapist can't you pay a therapist to review your problems with them and they give you feedback here's the thing and once you stop paying a sex worker they stop having sex with you yeah but the whole the whole point that's it's called work yeah no because point is it's more meaningful than that of course it is more meaningful I would agree just like having a really good intimate conversation with a friend is more meaningful than having a intimate conversation with a therapist around so many different places only because I'm following you on your tangents but well I was trying to ask you made a so if sex work is so if sex work is just a skill it's something that people enjoy yeah uh do there have to be is this something that only Specialists can well let's say for example so jine a lot of people do only fans they have other jobs like you're a lawyer people have other jobs so you can have someone who's a masseuse and do only fans or a therapist and does only fans yeah right okay so you could be you're like a sex worker By Night massuse therapist during the day would it be okay if they offered those sex Services as a part of their day job being depend on what the day job is if it's like a lawyer or something or if it's like a therapist probably not because you're violating like um an appropriate relationship to have with somebody um but if it's like you're auto mechanic and he also sells you pictures of his dick it's probably not as big of a deal let example so my my wife was a nurse at the hospital so she worked with um neurot talemetry and people have you know brain injuries spine injuries stuff like that and also older people and people who would need things like bathing and cleaning okay so they need um you know to be clean including and clean their parium paranal care so just like groin crotch but that kind of stuff sure and some of them would ask her and this would also happen to other nurses hey while you're down there could you just like you know play play with my we wee a little bit or you know masturbate me so let's say you have a nurse who is also an only fans uh you know is a sex worker on the side should she be allowed to offer that is my understanding and I'm not a medical professional but my understanding is when you're making decisions related to Patient Care a patient under your care engaging in Friendly or sexual relationships with them can cause an inappropriate Crossing of boundaries that compromises your ability to deliver good medical care so I would say that in the case where somebody's like a therapist or a medical professional that's making decisions relating to healthare it's probably not because you just related can't even accept on wait how did my relation to therapy to Friendship break anything that I just said because you're saying that you can't enter this new Dynamic of sexual relationship in a healthcare setting because that somehow violates the healthare setting what's being violated that's trans question why what did I just say was being violated what is being violated I I said it like three times I'll repeat it again it's compromising your ability to deliver care but if the care is including let ask this question including sex work you wouldn't include sex work and health work together in care unless you're so well un I mean we could we could invent a scenario that's true what if you're going to a hospital and part of the Care is my husband has issues with erectile dysfunction maybe part of the health services is them jerking you off to make sure everything's working in that case you would combine it would you agree or would you would you say so inappropriate you're wait I want to answer for that would you if that case would that be an appropriate combination I don't think you should go to people to uh jerk you off no that's do you think it would be do you think us ignoring your personal view do you think it would personal sexual view it's a view that's actually been held for thousands of years by many millions so if you're going to a hospital and they're trying to check you for working sexual function them seeing if you can get an erection that would be an inappropriate way for them to examine you I think if they are really trying to determine you can if you're if you can get an erection there's a way and you're a married person in a marriage there's what if you're not a married person what if you're single why would they need to determine that because believe it or not there are people in this world that even when they're not married they want to ensure that their sexual function is working and sex I really want to answer that I really want to answer that I don't I I you disagree with that you don't think your sexual function is relevant if you're not married I think it's relevant but I think that I don't think it would be good care to go into a hospital say there is I really want to answer this so if you have problems with erectile dysfunction it would be inappropriate for a healthcare provider to assess the ability of you to get an erection while you're at the hospital that's inappropriate I I mean I think it it depend I I'm curious what the standard of care is for that right now I mean do you know what the standard of care is I'm not but I'm asking it's a hypothetical but I'm asking if you go to the hospital you with the rec dysfunction doctor I've got issues and I say okay we're going to give you a medication we're going to try something and let's see we'll see if we get I think it would be a strange form of care to say well let's try I ask if it was strange or not was I don't think it would be appropriate don't think it that type of that type of health is totally out to be clear giving a medication would be appropriate it's fine to use medical treat stimulate them it's fine to use medical treatment to see if your body is working properly it's fine to do things to um acquire semen for example you might use for example with some patients use Electro ejaculation stimulation of the prostate in order to get well for some patients that's what you have to do including if they're paralyzed okay I'm understand what you just say was a way more hardcore Kink than water sports but okay goe no no to see if you can ejaculate to see if you're able there is a difference between trying to determine if your body is functioning properly and saying that sex is just a service that can be provided so if so hold on if we provide so if we provide people in the hospital we provide them all kinds of services to make sure they're comfortable right like we give them television they don't need that to live right okay but it makes them comfortable correct um yeah so we give patients stuff in the hospital to make sure that they're stay as comfortable we give them television we give them different food they can choose we give them bathing obviously and when they're very uncomfortable we turn them we do things to make sure they're comfortable so if a patient says sex would make me very comfortable why wouldn't if a nurse can clean the guy's testicles and penis and is already handling all of this why not just you put on the gloves and give him a a hand job well one is because it's illegal um two if it were legal my guess would be the procedure for that would be you would bring in a third party or you contct to somebody why do you bring in a third party let me let me finish let me finish why do you need to bring in a third party to give the guy a hand job and not a third party to wipe his butt and clean between his parum because when you start engaging in romantic or sexual or who say it's romantic it's just getting I said or or means any of these when you ran sexual that these things are inappropriate because they compromise your ability to objectively offer care for instance would it be inappropriate to say well can you please just like jerk me off you're going to clean my ass yes that would be because if a patient starts to have a sexual relationship with a practitioner then there then if that practitioner is to make a tough call on that patient's Health that might become right the same way that let's say the same way that let's say the person starts saying like man you know my kid why does sex do this St let wait let me just finish hold I got to finish this one thing oh my God okay let's say that the patient comes in or the the nurse comes in and the patient starts talking to nurse like man my kids aren't calling me like I don't know what to do and then the nurse sits around they start talking blah blah blah blah blah that would be equally inappropriate that would be incredibly inappropriate if they started to to form a very close friendship with the patient that would also be inappropriate because again if a tough call has to be made on the patient at some point you might not be able to make that tough call because now your judgment is compromised this is why uh surgeons that have like wives or husbands don't operate on them because their judgment is compromised if you can give hand jobs and you're not attached it's just sex work well right now in terms of how human relationsship work it seems to be you saying something very important which is that there is an emotional psychological component to sex as somebody so as a lawyer we have rules on how a engage with people we're not allowed to for instance I want to make sure I'm understanding Destiny correctly and what he just said hold on let okay let lla go then we'll have you come in go and I do want to get back to the contraception thing but uh but you had said that there's an emotional romantic connection to sex that's I think you I don't know if you often times there can be yes yes so that sounds like more than work it can be yeah so so you're talk when you when you guys talk about sex Sor wait wait I'm sorry real quick I reject that what do you mean that sounds like more than work when you talk about sex work like we can sell this commodity of sex like service to lead like it's a service you're saying well but more emotions and psychological romantic feelings get involved therefore it doesn't belong in the professional setting of healthcare that's what you're saying because but like so how can you still say it's work and it's a professional profession teachers work yes do they have emotional connections to children and parents they should that's a heal so that argument doesn't make any sense so what's the next one well are you saying that a nurse should not have an emotional connection at all to her patient generally they try to minimize it yes uh they they should have empathy that's actually required for nurses to have empathy they shouldn't have empathy they should have compassion and they're two different things because empathy they can compromise your ability are you saying a nurse can't understand uh the personal background desires hopes and develop a friendly rapport with a patient you can have where there isn't you can no no it's a key it's a crucial distinction having a friendly rapport with somebody is different than becoming personally emotionally invested in the outcome you have to maintain an appropriate level of distance whether you're a lawyer whether sex crosses that line because of what sex just intrinsically many things cross that line like I just said when you're a lawyer you can't accept certain gifts you can't get too close to your clients they can't become like best friends to you that's going to cause problems for you down the line we take entire classes on this on all the ways we're not supposed to get too close with our clients and it's not all sexually it's even just in Friendship so professionalism the standard for professionalism I agree it's not professional to offer sexual services to somebody in a in in a setting where that's not appropriate but there are other things that aren't appropriate either it doesn't mean they're all bad and that you can't use different so I think I mean the the point that you're making though is that sex is personal it involves roome it can involve romance it involves feelings it involves this connectivity that you sometimes can't help but have and that's our Point well have question that's not your point a very important part of our point no that's every single human's point we all understand that we everyone here agrees that a therapist you understand that but you also think it's acceptable to have SE these sexual relationships with potentially thousands of people onl you're not understanding the whole point of your argument has to do with dual relationships and you're trying to apply this to singular relationships we all agree here that a therapist having sex with a patient would be bad right why because it imps let's say the therapist is a sexist should be a sex therapist is obviously not the type of no but that's the thing sex therapist it's illegal for sex therapists to have sex with their own clients they can talk to them about hold on I'm not even sure that's true hold on okay let me okay I can't ask a question because I'm not going to get any engagement make my not true Jess it is a very simple question is can a therapist have sex with a patient and then you're like well what about Sex Therapy no no no I think J considers what she and they can't because it compromises your ability to give good therapy what I am saying is that if sex is just a service that is provided and it has we don't have to I understand the next stage of argument I'm trying to show why that's ridiculous I understand it you're going to say then I will take it out of the Dual Ro to the single Ro and I'll give you let's just explore this for two seconds and we can go to whatever you're going to jump okay a therapist cannot have sex with a patient because it compromises their ability to deliver good therapy we age their relationship right no that's not the only reason oh my God go ahead it it does it would also be equally inappropriate for a therapist to form a close friendship with and to go out and like have drinks or meals with a patient but it doesn't mean that drink and dinner are super not just that because when a therapist has sex with a patient Destiny it's grape because the therapist has a power IM balance over the patient and can manipulate their emotions and there are consent issues involved sure that's true as well that's not what we're focus more important reason okay we can pick a different we can pick a nurse and a and a patient as well I think it must be said that a lot of people involved in creating pornography and prostitution consider what they do a form of therapy for the client that's that's not there is a reason that the sexual revolution has coincided with us being more cognizant of things like consent because the whole point of is the sexual Revolution and allowing people more freedom and how they want to express their sexuality is that it's a choice but it's still your choice right that's why things like marital rape was outlawed in the '90s we have the rape Shield Doctrine you're not allowed to bring up a victim's past sexual history in a sexual assault case we have me too movement so I don't think like yeah Power and balances are important because that can get in the way of consent so consent is super important but what you choose to do is not that's what the sexual it's not it's on accident that those two things too is a reaction against the excesses of the sexual Revolution so I mean I think to say that these things are given to us by the sexual evolution is totally it is though like marital rapal fists early feminist you're saying me too is a is a reaction to What a me too is the reaction to the excesses of the sexual Revolution and a lot of the uh a lot of the reform that was requested in the way that marriages took place and marital rape protection was early feminists who were not sexual revolutionaries who themselves wanted family values and many of them were pro-life so to say that it was the sexual revolutionaries that gave us those two things coincided at the same time because the whole point of the sexual Revolution was that okay you're not going to be ruined now because you choose to have casual sex but if someone comes in because there was a lot of inappropriate harassment rape Etc statute of limitations has been increased due to the me tooo movement all of these things coincided because consent is a huge part of the sexual Revolution I I I think that and me too is a response to people seeing women as Commodities that they can acquire and seeing sex as a means of AC of acquiring that commodity basically it's it's responding to a dehumanizing view of sex now I agree many people don't have that view but I do think that the hedonistic view of sex does lead to that but here's the question I wanted to ask just to get back to what sex is for and why I think it shows that this view of sex is absurd all right suppose you had a friend and they said uh cuz this is parling on the idea that sex is just a it's a hedonistic activity people can share with consent like say for example like martial arts so martial arts if I go nobody thinks sex is like that but no no hold on let me say make the analogy if I start martial arts with somebody without their consent I'll go to jail because that's assault right I just go and punch somebody but I can ask them hey do you want to spar with me a little bit okay and then that's okay because we have consent and it's this kind of activity now imagine that you would it be healthy to have a friend who says hey um I'm glad you and I are getting into martial arts together um but I really feel like we can only be friends if you only do martial arts with me or we can only be friends if you only do tennis with me or I want you to be my only friend you're the only friend that I have with those examples would you say that those are disordered friendships probably yeah all right so my next question would be is it disordered for someone to say I want you to be the only person I have sex with you're the only person who has sex with me do you think that's disordered not necessarily no what's the difference between activities that are pleasurable and consensual martial arts chess tennis spending time together and sex then what's what is the difference between the two that one is disordered it's a friendship you should not get in and the other we would say not even that it's not disordered but it's the way things ought to be your life what's what's the difference uh I the difference is going to be the preference as of the people that are taking these things some people might feel like uh they like to do martial arts with a lot of people and for sexual activity I think people tend to prefer to be more exclusive with that um there's probably other things we could think of that is that natural should we think like that's the way they ought to treat sex whether or not it's whether or not it's natural or not is a separate question well it seems obvious that if someone says I want you to be my only friend and you can't have other friends we'd say that's a friendship you probably shouldn't get into right generally yeah then why like if we're going to use like don't we say the same thing then about I want you to be the only person I have sex with back we say it's a good so if we're talking sex work if a subscriber told to me you're the only person I want you to I'm the only person I want you to have I would say no that's not the context of this because you're selling a business and you can't have one customer yes but my point is that just because that's one way to see sex is like an intimate monogamous thing there are a lot of people who don't view it that way who don't want to view it that way and I'm wondering back to my original question where are these outcomes that are so detrimental to society that's happening because some people uh people that want to be polymerous not getting in the way of you don't think that 20% of couples expressing unhappiness because of porn porn use in the in the relationship CPL where is that yeah this is a study from um and then also the statistic about uh the amount of uh people that are um pornography use being uh listed as one of the reasons for divorce you don't think that that's meaningful it could many things that are listed as divorce but I have a bunch of studies here that show that since like I just told you porn that porn actually can have a cathartic effect on violence that STD rates come down there's a huge study that shows that AIDS or um yeah HIV could go down by 30 to 40% if we were to just decriminalize prostitution so there is evidence going both ways when it comes to porn and sex work and I don't see anything that's super conclusive that this is just a terrible harm more than stud Institute by the way about 20% of couples report a degree of conflict in their relationship due to pornography one in four men report hiding porn from their partner one in four men hiding it from their partner probably because they're looking at that prostate St porn okay but but I I think the the larger kind of the meta Point here and you were speaking to this earlier Destiny but then we kind of got you know the conversation unraveled a bit but you were saying about how we have all this technology and so now we can do now we can treat sex recreationally did I understand you correctly I'm saying that it's allowed us to change the way we view sex yes okay so my point is that even with the technology the natural consequences and outcomes still find the way even if we can live in unreality for a short time with the tech technology you know I'm just on only fans for a moment it's not going to hurt my relationship I'm going to use a condom here so I'm not going to get pregnant whatever it is right I'm not going to get this girl pregnant whatever it is the consequences catch up and when I brought up the G mecker Institute statistic the reason it mattered is because half of the women who are getting abortions according to the research arm of planned parented the biggest abortion chain report using contraception in the month that they got pregnant so they were using it they thought they were doing the safe safe sex thing and then they get pregnant and they show up for the abortion so my point here is I just you keep bringing up the stat like yeah it wouldn't surprise me if for instance like 70% of people that die in car acents are wearing seat bels that doesn't mean wearing a seat belt at bad it means like if you're going to be in a car AC you're probably in a car you're probably wear a seat belt if you're getting pregnant you're having sex you're probably getting into the car is promiscuous sex maybe we should consider not getting into the car so much I'm saying that number you're giving when that's saying like people were getting into the car is going and sleeping with the prostitute if getting into the car is he sex culture then maybe study you brought study I'm notar with this you said that what was that number that you quoted you said 50% of people said they were using birth control or whatever and they got okay socer insute the types of okay in that study for birth control did they include natural Family Planning and pull out method no this is a contraception birth control pills and condoms or barrier meth pull out method and natural family plan are both considered forms of contraception I mean that's like a very small fraction of a percent of people who even use that anyways first of all that's not true especially among Christians natural Family Planning true is considered one of the only ethical ways to do contraception which you know no this is this is this is largely birth control pills and barrier method condoms or diaphragms or otherwise okay all right I i' be curious if that's true but like even so it is true because we know there's a failure rate there's a failure rate there is a failure rate but like perfect use failure rate is like 1% um real you're having regular prisc sex or regular sex even with one partner that you don't want to have a kid with eventually there's going to be you know for many there will be a for you know hold on for many there won't be it's a 1% failure rate that's the opposite of almost a million abortions a year enough 330 million people I don't know if that's enough on can say many people that's not what 1% means 1% is not many one other point because I know that you think abortion typically is acceptable up to a certain point there's over 10,000 abortions that happen after the marker where you think it's a human life okay so is 10,000 abortions 10,000 murders you would consider it Mur of children that are viable in this country a year is that worth the promiscuity of adults 10,000 Mur you're linking that to to sex work and promiscuity I don't you just said oh it's affecting 20 alcohol is also like I think 10% of divorces list like alcohol is the issue is alcohol bad now I think alcoholism is bad alcoholism is bad but alcohol it doesn't have to be alcoholism do you think that's bad in moderation porn I agree if you have a problematic porn use is bad but is porn bad and is sex bad that's the question sex is great I think porn is bad what is the Jas what's the difference between porn use and problematic porn use problematic porn use is where people personally identify that's the medical term with it being a problem in their lives which is a very small the biggest the only representative sample we have puts it at like 4% is it possible for someone to use porn in a bad way if they don't personally feel anything bad about it what do you mean what's can you give me an example of how using porn in a bad way a husband uses a husband looks at porn talks to only fans girls masturbates to them uh and his wife hates it but he doesn't think it's a big deal and it's really hurting their marriage and just like if he drinks alcohol too much and she doesn't think and she doesn't like it but he still does it that's a bad it's bad when people violate the boundaries of let me try another one then let's say what if the wife says you talking to any woman on the face of the Earth hurts me and makes me upset would you say that that wife has an inappropriate boundary no because there's some there's a lot of people that are like that and they that that her husband cannot talk to any woman even like a female secretary she's so hyper jealous my family is from the Middle East this is literally how they set up societ you think that's good I don't think that's good but if that if there are people who that's the way that they're happy I don't think that's good I think the way you guys live your life isn't great you guys don't think the way I live my life is great the point is that when we allow people to do what's conducive to their own happiness that's but what I'm asking you is that can a spouse have e boundary expectations that are reasonable and unreasonable I think if we're going to use like a reasonable person standard that depends on like the community sh in certain communities that's and in your community porn is that talking the community this even this community out here who is you know um non-disclosed location uh you know uh would be listening in on this that an unreasonable boundary would be a girlfriend says my boyfriend can't talk to any other women that that would be unreasonable and a reasonable one would be my boyfriend should not be going around looking at other naked women that's fine but so like you you guys also think like masturbation in general not you not your what do you mean what do you mean by you guys well like i' I've watched your video you said masturbation just in general is is wrong I don't think that our community standard would agree with you I would agree that maybe I'm farther this way but you're definitely nowhere near where the reasonable I there there are definitely boundaries that are like pathological that are not okay and there are probably some that are okay we draw our sexual ethic is good or bad we're debating whether your sexual ethic is bad okay yeah and we're I'm where the only thing you have is that 20% of marriages have an issue with this 20 marriages have issues with substances and Etc are those things bad you said alcoholism is bad problematic porn use is also bad you should go get help from that yes and divorce rates have not gone up since the proliferation of porn but but the point is that porn is a is a prominent factor in divorce so is substance abuse so is alcohol would say substance abuse is bad so why are you saying porn is good I think no no wait wait cuz substance abuse wait wait wait you're saying substance abuse is bad therefore why isn't porn bad no that's not what I said that is literally what you just said you said why would sub context of why people get divorced Destiny is what we were speaking to no no but people don't get divorced because of substances they get divorced because of behaviors substance abuse but that you're saying they get divorced because of porn why not porn abuse yeah why my question problematic porn if it's getting in the way of your life bad but there are most of the people that consume porn which is the majority of people it's not getting in the way of the relation not getting in the way because we we can delineate we can say oh when you drink this much alcohol it makes you sleepy or giggly or fall down drunk or wrecks your liver like we can talk about the different effects at the different levels and what they do and whether it makes sense for a wife to tolerate or or a spouse to tolerate or not tolerate but when it comes to porn I think it's very fair for a spouse to say yeah I'm not going to tolerate my spouse um giving orgasm or giving that sexual desire to someone else my biggest problem with the view you guys are defending is that you lose any principled basis to say things like infidelity or even other you can't even Define what extreme sexual behavior is as long as it's consensual wait wait wait wait you can absolutely have all of these discussions just because you say I think that my partner can watch porn you're saying you can't have any more sexual boundaries if you grant that because I could exploit your life and find a million different things do you think your partner should be allowed to eat well yeah of course should they be allowed to have dinner with a member of the opposite sex alone at a restaurant maybe not that some people wouldn't be necessarily comfortable with that just because just because you allow some things doesn't mean that you've eliminated every single thing this goes back to my previous argument and saying about what boundaries are reasonable or unreasonable that if sex if sex is just another activity like other activities then it becomes unreasonable to demand exclusivity for it lit nobody here is saying that sex is just another activity you sure there are some activities that can serve a variety of different purposes okay for sex it could be recreational or it could be an incredibly emotional romantic Bond building thing much the same that we could imagine as I just brought up dinner could be whatever I've gone on to dinner with a ton of people that it's whatever but dinner can also be an incredibly romantic personal event some of these things even some people could set boundaries around and every he said that's fair if you say oh I went have to eat with like three or four friends last night you know Samantha was there oh that's cool that hits a lot differently than if you say oh I went have to eat last night with Samantha we went to you know Ruth's Chris we had like a $200 dinner wine under that doesn't feel fair that feels like cheating a lot of people would say that's that's not okay you've actually like cheated on your partner because you took another woman out on a date so I don't I don't agree with this idea that just because you're saying sex can be used like romantically that's the only way you can treat it and as soon as you've used it even a little bit on this recreational side you've lost all ability to have romantic because you would apply that same standard to literally any other activity in the world because sex is not like any other activity in the world I didn't say wait wait what do you mean it's not like any other activity it isn't sex is something that's unique because it has the ability to create new people it is designed to bring people together in a close intimate bond that no other natural activity is created towards and because it has those propensities we have moral Norms around it and that in order to have prostitution and pornography you have to say well those moral Norms are just what p people to the sex can be utilized for other things for instance when you masturbate you're not procreating and masturbation is about as natural as it gets plenty of people learn to touch themselves at incredibly early ages it's like a natural part of human development but it is not natural the state that we're in now where people can masturbate to all to a nearly an unending Supply I would like to finish please okay it's not relevant to what I just said but absolutely is relevant because we're talking about whether this is bad for society no we're not we were talking about if it was natural whether what's natural you're saying that sex is made for procreation and blah blah first of all ignore the fact that designed a designed process we could fight over that but that's going to get into religion but I'm telling you that there are forms of natural sexual exploration like masturbation as you're growing up that obviously don't produce children and aren't designed for that I I didn't I didn't say sex for procreation and that's not my answer to the question what sex is for but I'm getting back that even if someone didn't have a complete answer to what sex is for they wouldn't say oh well it's like dinner it's like other activities where there's just a multiplicity of meanings there's no correct meaning to it people have a lot of different meanings to it I think a lot of people would end up rejecting that wa rejected how when when when casual sex is so prevalent how who who would you mean a lot of people would reject that a lot of people would reject that when you talk about what is it what is it for like especially when you're in the context of a relationship well yeah in a context of relationship it changes of course and and the biggest the tell the most telling thing here in my opinion is all the social data shows the vast majority of it shows that these problems arise when there's no when there's a moral issue with it right because alcohol like you said there is a link they have linked at the amount you drink with the probability of it leading to problems with porn there is no link there's no study that can link the amount you watch with having problems with it in your social life and even not true true there are studies done by Nicole prous who is a pro porn advocate in 2013 that shows there's lesser reactivity in the brain to people who frequently use porn to be able to have attachment to spouses or significant others at all in 2014 and other further studies in 2015 were the first to use magnetic ronal imagery to show the actual changes that take place in the brain when people frequently use pornography it changes the brain and raises the dopamine ceiling so that in order to receive uh sexual arousal you need more and more uh extreme and even violent forms of pornography in order to reach that that's why you have things that now people are seeking out not just sex they're seeking out incest pornography they're seeking out beastiality they're seeking out group sex rape play and that is bad when Society Falls more into that the whole point of that Nicole prow study which I have here is it's the exact opposite of what you'd expect to see going on in the brain of someone with an addiction this is her words the findings are suggest self-proclaimed porn addicts don't quite have the same relationship with porn as someone that substance like with substance addiction so yeah she has done a lot of work I'm a big fan of her that shows that it's not a real addiction and a lot of it she was also in this big study that found this is the quote moral in congruence around pornography use is consistently the best predictor of the belief that one is experiencing pornography related problems or disregulation it seems to be unlike alcohol unlike substances that it has a lot to do with how you feel about it and I can just give you anecdotal experience from talking to so many people on my only fans my European fans those cultures where it's not like sex isn't seen as such such a like terrible thing the way they interact with me is like hey how are you can I get this video and they're like okay cool the people who have this moral in congruence they're behavior is super rtic they come they go then they delete everything then they come back sometimes they send you a Bible verse like these people are really struggling so but then there are people who consistently asks for more and more kinds of uh frankly bizarre so Nicole kuss uh uh talked about this study I think it was in Croatia where that there's actually evidence that they do it in the beginning and then they eventually the study done show that over time they go back to the vanilla stuff and she was attributing it more to people being like oh this is kind of weird like let me click on this and then over time being like okay I'm over it it's like kind of like a shock Factor thing that's what she found and that's what she talked about and I would say there was a 2016 uh study by right at all that did a metaanalysis the other thing I'm concerned about is it raises the dopamine ceiling and this was a study that was done across uh 22 countries showing an increase in the level of aggression in men who view pornography versus those who don't and I think that makes sense when you look at the most popular forms of pornography involving things like domination subjugation of women uh using verbal you know verbal abuse gagging asphixiation and and a lot of other things like I said earlier about the in increase in things like incest an incest role play real quick just on two questions so first of all when you say an MRI shows changes in the brain responding to dopamine levels of people that continue to use porn this is true of probably literally every single stimulating activity right yeah right like if okay so that's not unique to porn that would be the same in playing cars that'd be the same in eating potato chips be same in playing video games be the same in watching movies or Tik toks or whatever so I don't know what that's supposed to prove secondly just so I can understand this to it's in the relation of it's in the relation of what you find to be sexually arousing that people who continue to use porn and use porn more more frequently need more and more varied or disturbing or intense pornography in the same way that an alcoholic needs more alcohol to feel a buzz than when they first started drinking okay that's those two things are completely dissimilar wait wait wait wait hold on I'm sorry um real quick okay I hear this brought up so many times and I'm curious if there's an actual number on this I've heard this said over and over and over and over and over again people who consume porn need to dramatically increase the extremeness of the porn they're consuming what is the percentage of those people that that happens with because I've heard that said over and over again is that actually true or is that just like something we say we take well I think the proliferation of I mean even what we were talking about no that's not an answer I'm asking is an answer even if you don't like it the fact that when you look at pornhub's most Search terms over the past 10 years and see that it's extreme things which by the way your view can't tell me what's extreme or not 2022 the searches that defin 202 were reality gender group sex Outdoors positions feet and fum these are our top seven like types of searches do you think it's extreme people get from that's not the complete search list those are highlights that were put up there you have to scroll down more to get the highlight you said the top I'm asking what are the top ones the highlights that they put in that graphic I know the page you're looking at oh so you're saying that that if I go to look for the most common searches it's not those yeah oh okay te and stepmom or step sibling okay I'm sorry the most Search terms were hent Japanese oh no mil which is the opposite of teen lesbian teen is no yeah teen mysteriously disappeared after 2020 when at the same time PornHub was indicted not indicted when PornHub was being investigated for having child sexual assault materials and credit card companies were refusing to work with them if you go back and look at it from 2012 to 2019 teen is one of the most common categories search for it mysteriously disappears though after they have trouble with these credit wa wait does it mysteriously disappeared or they just eliminate the category to try to stand on the safe side of like all the well now now they've realized I don't know what they've done but they have seemed to have kept certain terms from being searched for but other people go and search for them and then of course there's other sites Beyond porn there sure there are okay but I think we would consider this a good thing this like a form of like regulation working right if we think that like people searching for teen and even the ones you put there would you say hentai is a more extreme version of pornography depends on what you're looking for would you say it's more extreme um do you think it's more extreme to to be aroused by watching someone be penetrated by tentacles well not all hentti porn is tentacle porn there's lots of different types of an but that's but that's a common element of it I don't know if that's wait I want back wait wait wait I want to back this question nobody answer this I want to know do do we know because I've heard this said over and over and over again that people that start searching for pornography are going to gravitate towards more extreme versions I'm curious what are the percentage of people that start on the pornography road that end up in more jine was using anecdotal anecdotal examples of her okay got you I just you can go on from that I just want to be clear then that this is repeated over and over again we have no number on that there's no data that's something that's said over and over again literally just told you what people tend to search for on the internet and it's not like loving couple has sex well and child sexual assault material is proliferating we're talking around it I just I had a very clear question I was curious how many people start with vanilla porn and move on I'm looking for a number between probably 100% because they start when they're when they're 11 years old and they probably see boobs naked people sex and then it quickly moves on from there based on these common Search terms you see what's on 100% of people move up on to hard no I'm sure not 100% I'm sure some 11-year-old finds hentai and then they're really in for bad because of the work I do in speak with young women and the New York Times and others have done um investigative reports on this what young girls are reporting about sexual encounters that they have with other young boys and the extreme and often um very uh uh disrespectful things that the young boys expect the young girls to do because of the pornography that they're exposed to on the internet so I think it's living in unreality for you both to sit there and let me finish please let me finish I think it's living in unreality for you both to sit there and say porn is harmless it's great yeah there's some bad stuff but has nothing to do with porn and everything's fine when the reality is of your average young girl and your average young guy today boy today who's looking at porn in the internet is being exposed to rape porn is being exposed to sexual assault porn is being exposed to child sexual assault material and a lot of young girls are reporting and yes we don't have the exact it's hard to know this it's not just the 2021 Bella deline one of the most uh no wait she just said a whole thing do we get the respond well the last thing I was just going to say is these young she's doing kidnap roleplay it's pretty pretty common I mean that thank you that's a good point I mean even this is a very prominent child a very prominent porn Creator who's doing what Trent just said but these young girls are reporting that they are being asked to do very degrading demeaning things that are scary for them it's even on this podcast I was at this on this show just rep saying how the guy wants to do these aggressive violent things with her and she's uncomfortable okay this is pervasive and you can pretend it's not happening but it is that's fine okay but like that we can argue that there might be negative uh sexual behaviors that might be being picked up from porn which is fine if you've got numbers on that I'd be interested however you don't think that's happening Destiny I do think it's happening but okay we don't I'm glad we can agree that that a lot of the problem is a lot of women push for it too so it's hard to it doesn't matter who pushes for it it has led to that is the point but we don't know if it's led to it though right it could have been there could be these desires that also weren't being expressed or being expressed in other ways before for instance things like I I can tell you what I'm saying you don't have to say you're saying I can just tell you I'm saying right things like for instance uh sexual behavior at the workplace is inappropriate towards women that's something that's been a Pastime in workplaces for a long time men treating women in sexually uh aggressive ways at workplaces that had nothing to do with pornography things like spousal rape or marital rape these are things that have existed for a long time that weren't encouraged by or made for pornography if you want to play history anecdotes you can look at all of the conquests of cities where they're sacked all the women is it your argument that the 11-year-old who's exposed to pornography and finds themselves suddenly looking at sexually very explicit sexual assault material uh pornography that when they then may try to act out aspects of it with a girlfriend their first time in real life that that's a result not of the porn but they think this is happening I don't think an 11-year-old I don't think an 11-year-old's first porn video is like bake throat 69 and then he Tak his 12-year-old girlfriend how do you how do you know misrepresenting what I said I said that the 11-year-old who's exposed to porn and gets hooked and starts to look for more and runs into because it's everywhere sexual assault material type porn torture type porn maybe child sexual assault material porn that that kid then if they act out some element of that in in a real life sexual relationship with a young girl your your argument is that well they would have done that anyways even without the porn no my argument is if you think that's happening because I'm 34 and I've grown up hearing all the same arguments from Jack Thompson about video games that you think a boy is going to play a game and take a chainsaw to a guy's face and S open and he's not going to go and Bully his friends or kill somebody at school you don't think these School I've heard all these if you think it's happening that's fine you given me a plausible scenario where it could then show it in the data then then show it in the data how many 11year olds are choking their 12-year-old girlfriends the New York Times report on this okay and the New York Times report is going to say that like this percentage of 11-year-old students are choking their girl point we I don't think we need to come here and say we know the exact we've you need to present an argument if you're AR you're saying 11y old on let me your AR saying 11y old bo are finding extreme porn and they're that girlfriend that's if that's happening that's pretty bad you have any evidence even if they're not acting it out with their girlfriend is it pretty bad is it pretty bad if somebody view something I I don't know the answer that we that's something think it's okay for an 11-year-old boy to suddenly start looking at rap probably not do you think it's okay for an 11y boy to hear his parents having sex do you think it's okay for an 11y boy to see somebody naked at a beach those are no no answer that answer that answer those questions do you think it's okay for 11 use them as comparisons you think that an 11-year-old boy I didn't say they were the same that's why it's a comparison was a comparison it wouldn't be two different things that comparing it would just be me saying the same thing twice they're not a meaningful comparison because I didn't let's find out if it's a meaningful comparison that's what I'm asking you can you tell me is it appropriate for an 11-year-old boy to hear his parents having sex no I think that's inappropriate but it is dramatically more scarring to walk in and see a rape happen scarring oh okay then give me the study dat consum 11year overwhelmingly women that are seeking out this kind of stuff so if there's a woman who's 13 14 I was one of these and I was like o choking kind of hot and then when I got a boyfriend I was like I want to try out choking and we both agreed that this is what we want to do how is that harmful are you saying that it's not bad for a 13-year-old girl to to seek out uh choking porn no I don't think it's bad I think if that's what you're so you think maybe maybe it's a good thing to show I also want to say where is this harm you think repeat this it's not bad for a 13-year-old girl to seek out porn where women are choked as part of I don't think it's wrong for girls when they're exploring their sexuality and they do that through porn if they like being dominated like I'm one of these girls to see that represented an adult to show a 13-year-old girl that yes but that's different it's different because there's that imbalance thing you're not supposed to show children this but if a child like if I when I was about a 16-year-old boyfriend shows a t her as if he's like hey are you into this I don't think that's bad either wait wait 16y boyfriend with 16y girlfriend or 16y boyfriend with a 13-year-old girlfriend with a 13-year-old girlfriend oh well that's that's different it's 3 years 3 years is typically if it's within the before it becom statutory raped when they're not even supposed to be having sex if it's 16 and 13 in most days they're not even supposed to be having sex they're 16 and 14 I know that the Romeo Julia L 15 and 16 or 13 and 14 whatever you want to say if it's two people of the same age and they're just exploring what each other likes and there's consent and both people are comfortable with it and it turns them on it's okay for them to exploit now let's go back then so it sounds like what you're saying is so fine 13 how about a 10-year-old girl is looking up this stuff I mean that's really young but I think that's still part of like normal exploration I wish I agree I wish this wasn't available to children does does CH are children harmed when they see pornography well the research on that is kind of mixed I actually have a couple so your answer is I don't know the answer is that there's uh research going in both ways and a lot it's not just me that so if the research so let me ask this so if the research goes both ways and we don't know should it be a crime should it be a crime then to show children pornography yeah I I think children yes but we're not talking about but why because saying we don't you're saying we don't even know also crime to give children alcohol is alcohol bad and the other thing I wanted to point out is you're talking about the link here's why it's a crime to give children alcohol that children cannot consent to activities that are capable of gravely damaging them or even damaging them at all like kids have to have their parents sign them up for sports teams they can't just sign up on their own so it seems like then that we'd have to agree that uh if if porn doesn't damage kids then they don't need parents they don't need consent and they don't need a law to protect them right if it doesn't damage them I think that the it's really mixed on if it damages or doesn't so to air on the safe side with children I'm okay with I wish we could keep it away from children but we can't can I okay let me so by that by that logic then you know people there's you know differing opinions about whether childhood football damages children too much or not so by that logic we should treat childhood football teams as being as wrong and necessary to Outlaw as showing porn to Children what okay wait here's a question which doesn't make any sense which what damages the child yes that's my question no that's my question to you now well you're the ones promoting sex work in pornography sure so I'm asking I'm asking I'm asking where you draw the line because you're saying that it's clearly not you're saying that porn is clearly over the line despite the fact that you presented absolutely zero data to support that point so you're giving that a child being exposed to pornography when they're 11 or 12 or 13 or whatever are having all these negative outcomes I don't think you provided a single stat for any of that or a single point for any of that other than it feels wrong I me which is fine it can feel wrong I did provide that I mentioned the 2016 right at all study with the 22 countries The Meta sorry 22 stud was of children that sounded of all people it's talking about children young people and Rise of aggression and use of pornography that's 22 studies across seven countries there are other studies that we can put forward but even beyond the studies it's just an OB to hear your response it just seems obvious to me that if a 12-year-old boy has access to Pornhub and can freely search it it won't take him long to find what we consider extreme pornography and if he finds extreme pornography what are those outcomes so you talked about sexual aggression there's a meta analysis from the 1970s to 2020 and it shows that some show that there is some show that there's not but the studies that were done over a longer period the link was weakened it's also been found that studies that employed higher level of best practices tended to provide less evidence of a potential well there's met biggest predictors for sexual aggression number one alcohol so again is cu alcohol seems to be actually showing us more conclusive harm in all of these respects is alcohol harmful is it bad there there's a meta I mean in excess it is absolutely there's a meta analysis that Trent and I have both ref that say that porn is connected to aggression um including and that's why and that's why for example with alcohol what we do is we have very stringent barriers to make sure to try to keep miners away from alcohol even though they do that so for example would you agree we to have very stringent barriers to keep children away from pornography for example all pornographic websites should require age verification I think that the problem is is that practically speaking the ones that are going to implement that are going to be the bigger ones but it's the internet you can't control the internet so what's going to happen is those sketchy sites in Russia are going to be why don't we just why don't we just have a rule that all pornographic websites have to have a triple X domain and then we can put them in one area that requires age verification how about that if if there was a way that we could actually make it so that you had to verify your age to be on these and that it wouldn't lead to just moving people over to sketchier places where they can still access because I don't know if you know the internet's pretty easy to find like crazy you don't and even if you go especially the sketch what's worse on the sketchier stuff what do you mean what's worse you're saying you're worried that if you use age verification to keep a kid off PornHub he'll go to a sketchier the sketchier stuff so for instance places like PornHub right now they have gotten way stricter with the type of content you can put out you can't put out like if you rape on U PornHub nothing comes up but if you go to like some of these sketchier ones they do come up so your your issue is more can can you do um Step sibling incest yeah and I don't think that's necessarily like okay if someone views step sibling incest where what are they doing what are they doing with that that's so harmful to is Step sibling incest bad step sibling watching step sibling in no I just saying is the act of Step sibling incest bad I wouldn't say it's 100% bad and I want to know if you're saying it's bad why where where are the outcomes cuz I'm looking at shouldn't have sex with each other I'm looking at outcomes here so I'm saying if people are watching this more aggressive come if you have I don't need a study to know that I shouldn't have sex with my sister whether she's by law or blood or brother is watching it is watching it increasing step sibling incest that's my question is watching this stuff increasing it happening are people having more incest now in real life or are they just watching it it desensitizes one to it yes so are but is that actually leading because the same thing happens with violent porn but there's a lot of studies that show it can kind of have a cathartic effect and that sexual crimes actually decrease when people watch it so my question is there's a meta analysis with 22 studies that show that a increased use in porn increases okay this is a meta analis of even more that shows that some of them do some of them don't but the ones that had best practices show a weakened link so I get what best practices best practices means like having the uh like peer review better control group more people studies not the point yeah I'm talking about studies so the studies that have best practices employed that's what this meta analysis from 1970 2020 found show that that that weak that link is actually weaken and you look at actual crimes happening what I am surprised I am surprised by is that you can't make a moral decision without saying well let's see what these psychological studies say even though we're in the midst of a replication crisis well let me finish we're in the midst of a replication crisis where many sociological studies in some instances 70 or 80% can't be replicated so we don't know if the stud's conditions are accurate we can't just go with the very BAS Bas element of hey getting an erection at watching fake rape that's probably a bad scenario that's probably bad if people do that well here's the thing you're talking about incest right if we're seeing that people people are watching step sibling step sister stuff it's not making them more likely to do we have no evidence it's not leading to Greater aggression in societ it's not leading to anything if the harm is just minimized to them seeing it and being aroused by it is that I just want to get something clear I just can I get something clear you're okay with people being aroused and ejaculating over rape porn you're okay with that as long as it's something that if it's not real and if it's consensual actors yes you're okay with someone getting aroused and ejaculating over um uh incest porn yeah as long as and would you be okay with someone ejaculating and being aroused over child sexual assault material provided it wasn't a real child it was a simulation if it and same thing if it was a simulation I would look at what the consequences are if it's leading especially when some of them show it's leading to less actual harm to children or if it's leading to less sexual aggression in person if it's leading to less ESS which a lot of studies show then I think yes I think if you're just getting aroused by it there's no harm being done what about a child being raped but it's a simulation and it's okay for someone to ejaculate over that in your mind I would say that if that if okay here's the thing some people have that proclivity and if watching it when there's no real child if it's Ai and that prevents somebody from actually acting the as a there EV that prevents it there's evidence that watching that here's differ a cathartic effectual here's difference okay so it sounds like you're saying well how can we really how can we really know that people desire something virtually that they don't also we have no idea if they really want it in real life if it primes them for that that's not what I'm saying saying what you're saying is that they might be confined to the virtual and so they don't have the desire to do it in real life all the evidence that we have shows that it either is confined to the virtual or it's actually preventing at least when it comes to sexual aggression yes I have three what is one of the main is it true that one of the main reasons there's different reasons women quit only fans right is one of the main reasons that they find they make more money doing escorting I have no idea I never heard of any I know anyone I know has never quit to do escorting no do any do any people who do only fans make supplementary income from escorting some do it's against the rules of only fans if they found out you get kicked off but or other camsites I'm sure they do but what so do you think then in those cases that it's plausible someone begins on a camsite they're excited by this virt and then they want to take it to the next level and that's how that happens what do you mean what happens they're now sexually assaulting the no they're having a physical active intercourse with this person they first experienced on cams yeah what does that have to do though with having higher R of child what I'm saying then is that if we see in these circumstances where someone begins they're aroused by virtual contact with us with someone and then they instincts well I want to take it to the next level that's going to really make me aroused and go and meet that girl in person why wouldn't that apply also to Virtual acts absolutely even people like Jordan Peterson have talked about how there seems to be a cathartic effect from watching it that actually leads to less of this happening in real life and I have some studies that show that we you you have no evidence saying that people watching this leads to more of it in fact there's evidence that's lean leaning in the other direction you wanted to you wanted to ask something yeah these arguments are completely and totally disconnected the idea that if somebody gets into some type of work they might continue on down that type of work doesn't at all feed into like well isn't it obvious then if somebody watches por like that's like saying like if you start drinking at all you're going to become an alcoholic and it's like why would you say that well isn't it likely somebody that works as a barback might become a bartender someday so why wouldn't like that that argument is no there's no connection whatsoever there are many cases of people that are um ultimately caught for the use of child sexual assault material and one of the things that gets them extra penalties is that they were actively seeking to act out the fantasy that they were playing and the attacks that they were doing against these children in their mind in on real life children and they had difficulty accessing real life children so I think it's it's a very it's a very much living in unreality argument that I think living unreality you have no evidence of actually increasing to say that people can live this whole life in their minds that they're acting out in their bodies through ejaculation and that's not going to affect anything that they do in the real world but yet that seems to be the case with movies and video games where a a k can sit in front of a computer and play 12 hours a violent video games a day and bl beh ho he doesn't go on The Rao and kill somebody I think training yourself and actively sexually arousing yourself and ejaculating over these activities I don't think there's a mental arousal agree mental arousal that happens when you're out there killing people in video G connection think it's an there the connection has connection has sexual abuse has gone down since the proliferation true not child seual my phone from a study from the University of New Hampshire that the CLI of 30% or more and sub is this reported child sexual abuse Jasmine yes so where's your evidence then that it's just unreported now but it's going up because people are watching we have insane rates of child sexual abuse in this country and it's gone up since the proliferation of had well it's in conjunction with the then it should go up if if porn being introduced to society has let has made this worse then where is that evidence it's not just porn it's also we haven't talked about this very much it's also prostitution you want data I'll give you data look up show at all CH a 2013 study covering 150 different countries showing an increase in human trafficking when prostitution is legalized wait who no none of us even disagree with this yeah that's that's but that's but that's sex work why is sex work bad prostitution is sex work sex work's bad because it leads to other bad things like human trafficking but that doesn't make the sex work itself bad yes it does because you can you can use other me let's say let's say it was the case that most of the AL we drank in the United States came from the cartel would that make alcohol bad no it would make it bad if using alcohol also fueled some other extremely dangerous violent form said let's say that hypothetically opium was grown in in the fields of Afghanistan and that was a huge export for them does that make it bad to consume all products all medical products related to painkillers no I'm not talking about remote cooperation with evil what I am saying is that if you have different policies when it comes to something like prostitution for example if you have a policy where you Legalize It And so it's legal to both buy and sell sexual services like you say you have in German or or other countries where that's allowed you have an increase in human trafficking but if you have other countries the increase in human trafficking isn't necessary for the sex work it's just a byproduct I explain yes it is and I will explain why because when you legalize prostitution two there and let's say human trafficking goes up or down there's going to be two different things that happen here there's going to be the scale effect and the substitution effect so the substitution effect would be oh you would think if prostitution is is legalized you know human trafficking will go down because you have legal prostitutes now they substitute for the illegal prostitutes and the hope would be it would go down because of this substition what I'm sorry wait what is the substitution effect the sub there's the question of the relationship between human trafficking wa I'm just curious what is the substitution effect the substitution effect is that I human trafficking would go down illegal prostitution goes down because it's substituted with legal prostitutes you have sex with a legal prostitute instead of an illegal one that's the substitution effect that that would drive the number down the other problem though is the scale effect that when you make it legal there is now a massive increase in demand for this and there's not enough prostitutes in order to satisfy the demand so trafficking goes up in order to meet that demand so the Cho at all study 2013 15 countries including longitudinal the show Germany before and after so it's not correlative shows that the scale effect always dominates the substitution effect so when I look at that I say oh legalizing prostitution this way that seems really bad maybe we should do something else like the Nordic model where you don't criminalize women for selling Sex You criminalize men for buying it and that really back to my original question then wait wait wait wait wait wait wait before before we jump into a whole different thing okay so back to my other question if for alcohol then if it was the case that we just every time we buy more alcohol it seems like you know in either cartels or gangs or whatever are the on producing it would you then say that we ought to outlaw alcohol because like every time we increase our purchasing of it it always comes from it seems to come from unethical sources we should outlaw alcohol if there are more social ills than social benefits talking about social ills benefits very that is always the case that you make you said that there a sub can I finish can I finish hold on you just talked for like 30 minutes you want to answer a simple question I did answer and you're interrupting me I said that if there's when you have social benef when you choose to Outlaw something you have social benefits and social ills that you have to weigh involved alcohol provid social benefits and there are also social ills I'm only talking about the substitution and the scale effect those the only two I don't know why we're bringing this whole other thing now you alcohol Destiny what's the question that you wanted he said that there is a substitution effect where when you legalize something you bring in legal prostitutes instead of a consumption of illegal prostitutes however the scale effect due the increase in the overall consumption of this particular good or service leads to more people being brought in in sex traffic so the the the fact that you're trying to substitute it legal for illegal people doesn't matter because even if the percentage of illegal consumption decreases the overall per capita increases which causes an increase in the illegal amount of of prostitutes being used so therefore increases sex trafficking so my question was well let's say if we take something like alcohol or any other good or service you can buy if it was the case that the mass scale consumption of this necessarily means that it's being consumed from countries that are engaged in slave shops or drug trade or cartels or whatever would you it's not it's not a correct analogy you'd have to show me an example where you have a legal and an illegal version of the same product in the market where it's being purchased and it drives the illegal version of the product up you're using no you're using it but it's too disanalogous to even make the point that you're trying to hold it's not disal I'm saying let's say there's a drug this drug is something that a bunch of people around the United States smoke or drink or whatever but let's say that it was okay well let's legalize it but then when we Legalize It there's such a demand for it that now like all the cartels in Mexico are making it would you say we shouldn't legalize it because of that reason yeah if it if it leads to a greater net increase in substance abuse to harm Society then we might want to Outlaw that talking about substance abuse I'm just talking about an increase in the people selling it being bad people because we have such a higher demand for it now the supply is coming from like it's not selling that's the whole point here it's not about selling a product and the bad people it's about the fact that when prostitution is legalized sex slavery goes up and the fact that we're even having this discussion about comparing people in sex slavery to products made in different countries very much shows the entire problem with the situation if you want we compar to sweat shops then if you want to do that sweats versus like normal with your analogy Destiny is that sex is good and sex is beautiful between in the right context and so to compare it to alcohol but restrict it just to prostitution sex happening is also a problematic because I mean alcohol you can use in the right context right sex in the right context and our position is is an amazing and a great thing what our point is is that in the context of sexual exploitation and commodification commodification that's when it becomes problematic and um and and harmful and wrong and Jasmine you were saying well for kids there's no problem with kids looking at pornography necessarily um Etc problem I said that it's not this I think having alcohol violent video games all of this can show just because something has harmed doesn't mean that now we need to get rid of it right the Second Amendment guns probably do a lot more harm than porn does anyone here want to B gun the First Amendment right people say mean things on the internet now because we have the First Amendment but that outweighs that so if you want to say something should be banned because of social ills I need a lot of evidence we're talking hold on hold on jasine we're talking about is sex work good is the question and you ask well what about you know kids looking at objectifying pornography on the Internet or you know sexual assault porn that's not necessarily bad there are over a hundred studies that have revealed links between young people's exposure to objectifying content and their objectification of women or self-objectification those exposed to objectifying portrayals are more tolerant of or in agreement with sexual harassment adversarial sexual beliefs rape myths child sex abuse myths and interpersonal violence than participants without this exposure and experience greater body dissatisfaction appearance anxiety and disordered eating belief so to say again to to argue that kids being exposed to porn or for that matter adults using porn is harmless there's no negative effect to them or the way they view other people is simply I didn't say there's no negative effect to them I'm saying the negative effects are not even that conclusive adolesence in pornography what are the negative effects what the negative of of research since 2005 more than 65 empirical Studies have appeared with a peak of 11 articles in 2011 the reviews have come to opposite conclusions notably about the question of whether pornography is related to adolescent sexual attitudes and behavior so some find there is some find there isn't the problem here is that if we just do evidencebased I have a lot of studies that probably show the opposite of so we can just ask a basic question which I have been continually asking and did not get a straight answer from that you seem you're not committed to the idea that it's just bad it's bad when children 10 11 years old C porn if it is bad like you say there's some studies say what is bad what does it what does it do to them you came close earlier you guys are saying well they might not understand how sex ought to be or determine what's real or not real in it would you agree that pornography has distortions of sexuality in it that children like what I mean I especially if you look at so in fact like things like only fans has made that problem better for just general Society a lot of studies on only fans shows that it actually helps people understand sex people report feeling more educated they report improvements in their sex lives so sex education is good right like if I have a child my point isn't going to be like porn bed it's going to be like hey look this is not how sex always is right if there's and now there's so many different kinds of porn out there that show different kinds of sex amate is there some kind of consensual sex that people should never do like can you give me an example well I'm sorry is there some kind of sexual behavior I will give you an example I'm curious to see how your guys's ethics would apply to this cuz I think that this view of sex that is not that is grounded in pleasure even if it's grounded in consent you're going to have problems I give you an example so a month ago Peter Singer one of the most famous philosophers in the world uh shared an article on Twitter from the Journal of controversial ideas and he said this is really interesting uh and it was a defense of beastiality okay and it was an interesting defense of it because I think it goes through many of the common arguments that are made against beastiality and shows why a lot of don't work uh you know for example uh well I guess I mean I could ask you I'm sure I know what your reason would be but it seems like okay I'll put it this way all right I think what you might say is that obviously beastiality is wrong because in order for sex to be moral there has to be consent and animals can't consent yeah okay that would be my view I don't think I don't think that that's a a good argument because we eat animals number one yeah that's go we eat animals without their consent we do normally we just say to to do a scientific experiment on somebody you need their consent right you're a lawyer yeah you need their consent but there's certain things at least you you can't do even with their consent now right but to do any scientific experiment you need the patient's consent yes but we do scientific experiments on animals all the time without consent and I'll give you um one you know one more example so let's say like uh police can9 units uh I gave the martial arts example earlier that if I do martial arts with somebody without consent that's assault they need to be okay with me punching them in the head so police officers train K9 units and they assault them they fight them they teach them how to subdue a a suspect they basically get involved in fighting with a dog and the dog can't consent to that but we don't consider that animal abuse so if it's okay for cops to rough up a dog to teach them how to subdue a a suspect why wouldn't it be okay for someone on only fans to let their clients see their dog lick PE peanut butter out of their vagina so this is different we probably have different views on this I don't think that that's okay I don't think the way we treat animals is okay I I would disagree with I don't think we should be testing on animals the way that we are we treat them as completely nonhuman I don't think that's necessarily intellectually consistent are you vegan I'm not vegan but I'm an for that okay yeah I should be but of all but no but of all the ways we could treat animals M of eating them doing experiments on them U making them do hard agricultural work do you think that the do you think that the least violent way to treat them would be things like letting them eat peanut butter off somebody's penis some of the experiments that they do on animals especially when it comes to like mental health where they like purposely put monkeys and scare them and do all this I think yeah you if you just a monkey it' probably be better than if you did all that to a monkey so that you can so that you can gauge how how did we get to Monkey if sex is just for pleasure animals like pleasure too and we're all animals we're a different species this View that under's prostitution pornography can't coherently explain why it's wrong and I think that that's a problem well I just I would just like to make a quick statement I just like toit the whatever podcast does not endorse beastiality I do I I need to do a couple chats here and then we'll continue on with the conversation we have Dr Clockwork a common reason of divorce is leaving the cap off of the toothpaste is brushing your teeth now bad correlation does not equal causation people have lots of reasons for divorce usually more then blank okay Dr Clockwork thank you appreciate it we have Devon frame here coming up in just a sec just waiting for it to pop up hey Devon frame thank you human beings tend to twist and molest everything they dip their toes in you religious folks should know that well how do you propose we better build healthy functional adults harar milker I have no idea what that means but uh um how do you propose we build we better build healthy functional adults I don't know if that's virtue really worth okay habitual predisposition to choose the good okay I think I think it I think you have to have a realistic assessment and you have to acknowledge the real biological forces that exist in people rather than trying to Design Systems around virtues that are of religion or other sorts of origination um we've seen this fail over and over and over again and it has failed and it will never come back the idea that sex can just be confined to one marital thing is just something that even for most of human history hasn't gone well I think when people try to have relationships where sex is open and can be shared with lots of people that's where we see failure sure but we see 50% of marriages fail that don't even have those issues so it seems like I think that the I think that the better thing to do is to say there are different ways you can engage with sex here are the pros here are the cons if you engage with it in this way things like this can happen or things like this can happen and then if you engage with it this way here are the good things or bad things I think the problem is everybody is so ideologically driven to attack one side or support another they end up making absurd statements like you know everybody should be happy with this style of monogamous sexual relationship and marriage and anything else is wrong or everybody should be you know in a poly 500 people and that's totally okay we say everybody deserves love that doesn't need to be satisfied uh by other people as sexual objects yeah that's fine and that that sort of view has led to you know histories of marital rape and women not even like having orgasm Rel that sex has a particular design to it and we can pretend that it doesn't but it does and that design tends towards intimacy and connectivity between to people and it can also create life and I think when we pretend that that's not the truth about sex and we say that sex is just whatever I want on my own terms provided there's consent then we open the door to all of these things to your point Jasmine you're saying well there's all these studies that show pornography doesn't cause so many issues I have all these studies that show that they actually lead to object objectification in real life and all these other problems um when you look though at the data of people who are promiscuous or having multiple sex partners that's when you see in in what are people doing in real life people very harmed and people experiencing more addiction people experiencing more mental health issues yeah but wait so then do you think that we should heavily discourage again to to worldview of saying that sex is whatever and let people do what they want to do so wait wait so all form all forms of sex and that aren't leading to like procreation and relationship building between husband and wife then in your eyes are basically like things that should be heavily SE uh socially discouraged as an example this is a New Zealand St wait no no wait I'm ask I'm asking for a moral perspective like for example this is not a moral perspective this is no no you just G when you say sex is designed for something that's a moral perspective it's a philosophical position yes I'm talking about the data proves I'm not talking about I'm asking you morally you think that the only type of sex that should be encouraged in society or should be allowed in society should be sex that is for the design of like having children basically uh I think it can include having children but no it's designed for the for marital love what about I just so for things like gay sex or lesbian sex in your ideal Society are these things essentially not allowed or discour I think that sex is designed for Lifelong Love to two between two people and it is designed to be lifegiving now that doesn't mean every sexual act is life-giving or that everybody can give life through sex but it's designed for that and I think that's the reason one of the reasons yeah but can we engage outside of that so for instance are gay people having sex always committing a social sin in your eyes is that always a bad thing I think that yes I mean I don't think that do you think that all forms and one more thing do you think all forms of sodomy are also do you think that all forms of sodomy are also like social sins so any oral sex any anal sex all of that is also again I think if you want to talk about the the Catholic teaching on this and I'm asking for your teaching iath teaching I'm a Catholic or I was our view is not what's we're not debating whether Catholic teaching on sexuality is true or not or good the position that you're giving to counter the sex work debate are ones that would necessarily include these even if you don't hold this position you can say this well but you haven't given those arguments well here's what I well no here's what I would say the question of whether homosexual conduct or sodomy sodomy whether it's between people of the same sex or people of the opposite sex the question of is that disordered you cannot answer that question unless you have answer a previous question which is when is sex ordered okay so I put forward the view that I think the only way to explain why things like incest beastiality uh you know Infidel you know gross pris infidelity other things ordered towards a very particular expression of love between a man and a woman but even if you didn't hold to that view uh your view can't really say when sex is ordered when it's properly ordered to a certain end all you can say is well you just got to make sure it's consensual but after thatal I think yeah I think that we can propose like very simple things around like as long as it's consensual as long as it doesn't lead to like obvious exploitations of like certain people so for you probably should be able to have sex and your something righty the question today is is sex work bad for society and we're talking about you're talking about and and presenting a view of sex where provided there's consent between adults everything's fine and dandy and you're saying well the data Bears out from pornography that it's fine and dandy I'm saying well we have all this data that shows that it's not and you're saying well we then and the consensus is on my side and and and there's a lot of other data that we haven't even talked about yet that before wait wait before we get into that let me just read the rest of the chats we have four chats so let me just get through them and then we'll uh continue on Modest Tama hey thank you man Brian love the real debate format thank you for setting it up Destiny props for coming back multiple times although I mainly disagree with you it is nice to hear actual discussion from the other side rather than Libs screeching lib screeching be a good band name that would be a great band name Destiny did you play any instruments by chance or went to school for music so yeah okay piano and saxophone yeah okay there you go we have fear Maddox hey thank you hello Brian I find this interesting I have friends who goes out much Etc and I'm that only friend who doesn't because I have some level of self-respect Virgin my friends don't believe me why do people think there aren't men who have self-respect not entirely related to the conversation because it's it's like look down on in our culture to be a virgin or to pursue Pur pursue abstinence and I think good for you I think that takes a real a lot of virtue good for you P madx we have Kyle wittington hey thank you question for Destiny and Trent at what point is consent wait hold on I'm sorry can I respond to the last one no if hold on I'm sorry real quick you want to go back to the last one yeah if you want to be a virgin or if you want to be promiscuous you should do some exploration of your own values and don't let people like um lla so I'm not allowed to encourage you're not allowed to bully people cuz that's just whenl answer the answer shouldn't be the answer shouldn't be the answer shouldn't be good for you for uh you know having self-respect but because that's the exact same answer that Third Way F whatever like affir the boundaries he set for himself I thought sex was all about respons you should say is you should figure out what work best for you sex you should do that exploration and because if that guy would have said hey I went out and I 20 people and my friends all looked down on me why don't they have self you wouldn't be affirming his bound you'd be saying oh affirm that I would think so so you weren't affirming anything healthy for him you just like that he ideologically with of affirmation in this debate that someone pursuing ABS you should affirm people because they've done the appropriate level of exploration to figure out this what's right for them because you're Rel the question isn't whether some question isign with IDE me for having the view that people credit for exploration I give them credit for having the right answers gotcha having the right answers doesn't matter what matters is how you get there that's more you're assuming that he doesn't get there through some thoughtful process and I think that's unfair when your answer is cuz I have self-respect that's the answer everybody gives to justify literally any stupid Behavior I I I think that that's I think that that's uh diminishing this young man and people talk about respect to justify good behavior that they're disrespected or they have respect for themselves and they're not going to do things like allow themselves to be objectified resp can be a respect can be a very good reason for something you can't just throw it down theam that's great and the same argumentation has been used to shame women out of even exploring their own V so they're 30 years old like you can use shitty arguments to justify anything that's why I'm saying it's the argument that's matters not like the correct out what triggered you or what yeah it's the idea that when people just give a position they say I do this and my friends think that BL blah why don't they have respect then it doesn't sound like something they've truly explored it sounds like a position they've been like either bullied or brainwashed into and not SP a good time that comment that comment that was the Assumption I could be wrong I I don't think I think that it's unfair to assume that simply because someone is that's great but You' already affirmed that if they would have given the exact opposite answer with the same argument you would have disagreed with them so you don't even care about the argument you just care about think you're making the point the point that I was trying to make which is that in our society today we applaud or accept um sexual promiscuity that is not true I think largely speaking especially like younger people it's actually feels shameful for some of them if they are a virgin they think oh what's wrong with me and I think that we've forgotten we've we've we've lost a sense of respect and appreciation for people who are trying to live a virtuous life what point in US history is everybody proud to be virgins I think today people no no when were we are you saying like in the 80s people were proud it's like I'm 30 and I'm a virgin I'm 25 and I'm a virgin it's not so much about even virgin as it is about virtue is it about having um self-restraint and choosing I'm just going out having casual sex and so I think that was the point of this young man that making and I think that that's a good thing okay all right we have uh Kyle wittington question for Destiny and Trent at what point is consent IR relevant what would be some examples of actions that would be wrong regardless of consent and why well actually I have an example of this Destiny said something that reminded me got you talked about he also said exploitation and you talked about selling kidneys that actually does have a little bit of a relation here it's not just we've been talking a lot about Behavior like doing this doing that but the big problem with prostitution pornography is the money okay it's money that leads to things like exploitation so for example uh I would say it's good for somebody to donate plasma donate bone marrow donate kidneys that helps other people and it's good that they do that but when you start but if you pay people for those things for example the United States is one of the few countries on Earth that pays people for blood plasma most other countries on Earth you can't be paid for blood plasma and we do it here and most blood plasma donation centers they're at like they're on the border they're in the poor parts of town and when you pay people so we have to ask even though they're consenting to giving up parts of their body is that exploitation that they're basically doing it because they're trying to get money if we have ethical problems about using money to get people to give up their body their their blood their bone marrow their kidneys and that we're exploiting them because of the money that's involved the same questions will be raised about people who will get money by giving their body and something like only fans and it's out there as a virtual image and it's out there permanently the same ethical issues get raised about exploitation who's exploiting me who's exploiting you yeah you just said that if you do sex the the the CEOs that make millions of dollars from uh only fans and don't have to take their clothes off you could say that about any but any industry in America then you could say capitalism because most Industries you don't take your clothes off it's possible taking the close off it's the taking the close off that you have issu it's the moral issue you have it's not the moral issue it's the commodification and it's possible to exploit oneself that's why you can't sell your own kidney or you can't sell your own 299 thank you for Trent Jasmine and Leela do you think it is a big brain move for a husband to let other men cream pie his wife or for him to suck men penises or is it more likely to cause a failed relationship we're not answering that good question I think that one of the things you're talking about when you talk about the Kenny thing is we've talked about consent a lot but I think the topic that we're really getting toward is something called informed consent so somebody's ability to give consent to something for instance a 14-year-old can theoretically consent to sexuality with an adult but they can't have an informed consent because they're only 14 we would say can they decide to have sex but do they understand all the ramifications no and that's where the issue between whether it's moral or immoral comes in I think when we look at things like kidney donations I think that when we look at the informed consent we're looking at is there a group of people that are they have enough knowledge to make a decision and if they do uh and there no other mitigating factors the question then becomes like why would you prevent them from doing so so let's say for instance we say okay we do blood plasma donations but that we pay 50 bucks a service for or you know like medical studies we pay people for participation in if you do that is it an unethical transactions well let's say you say yes it is and then we get rid of it well what have you what what like what are the social goods that you've achieved there we have less blood plasma donated people that are poor that could have made money donating plas don't have it anymore like like what what is the positive outcome that's happened there because we can't just make ethical decisions based on what is the most positive outcome that's consequentialism or util arianism even that we could do all kinds of things to try to make the best positive outcome for example you could maybe set up a system where orphaned children a small subset of them are used for uh child sa and then that prevents children overall from being victims of child essay and so the overall rate goes down would that be good because we had better consequences no because we did something grossly evil to try to get the good consequences and it's similar even if we have more of a shortage of things like kidneys and we we do need more kidneys and and organs it doesn't justify us doing things that are evil or exploitative like taking organs from dead people without their consent even though they're not alive anymore to consent or or using money so that the people who end up doing it are the poor who are in a worse place to be to be exploited and want to go and be able to do something where they are greatly benefiting Society uh but incurring massive Harms because of this kind of exploitation yeah but then I think that's this doesn't have to be this could literally be we could look at this as a virtue or dally we're not talking about sacrificing some group of people to save another group people harming some group of people to save other people we're just talking about an individual giving up your kidney it harms you well I'm saying things like blood plasma the kidney stuff obviously moves a little bit more you can donate blood plasma 100 times a year we don't have long-term studies what that does to people it may not be healthy okay but we do have long-term studies on what like blue collar labor does to people sure is that exploitative that we allow people to get engage in backbreaking work that leads to negative Health outcomes it might put them around asbestos it it dep it depends on the particular occupation so if we compare like construction work to blood plasma donation what arguments do you have to save construction work from the negative arguments you've constructed to destroy the exploitative effect of like because construction work and this goes back actually to sex work because construction work is uh a service that creates a good it's a particular kind of service or skill that's offered with blood plasma what we are doing is we are commodifying people and one of the overarching criticisms of pornography and prostitution including from non religious feminists from the past 40 years is that prostitution pornography are wrong precisely because this is not a service that is offered to people it is the purchasing of a commodity and a simple thought experiment shows that wait let me finish thought experiment the simple thought experiment is if people have a choice between two streams that they want to pay for and let's say one is Jasmine's uh 5,000th stream you know special access cool stuff I'm going to do and the other one is Megan from Nebraska barely 18 my very first stream this one's going to be the far more popular one with real jobs people value expertise and experience with commodities like a car you value that it doesn't have a lot of miles on it and people treat pornography and prostitution and the women involved more like cars than they do like service work you say that that argument also applies to every single form of Athletics no because you value an athlete has more experience and so they have a greater skill side what's the average age of like a female Olympic gymnast but they have tremendous skill as the point they have skill and experience wait wait wait what isn't the average isn't the average age like 14 years old not just age the fact is that someone would rather prefer a cam or porn or something with a girl it's my first time whereas a gymnast if it's their first time doing the uneven bars we don't prefer that wa wa so now so now we've liter so now we've narrowed this all the way down to it's just the fact it's the first time because commodification of bodies are people like these are things that also happen in a wide like somebody who's younger somebody who's got less damage especially when we talk about sports I feel like for athletics this is going to apply I don't know how you can look at athletes and say they're not commodified under this lens they can't they can be treated inhumanly people can be treated as Commodities or inhumanly but I'm saying that sex work that's why I don't like that phrase it's not even work there's a whole host of other things that are involved to say that we should treat especially prostitution like a job to me seems insane what about acting what about what you what about acting would you say like women actresses are also treated as Commodities cuz a woman actress might be oh she's only 22 she's like hter we can hire her to do this job instead of they want to be a good actor they want her to they want her to have me if you do porn they also want you to do whatever pornographic actions are going to do as well right but Trend point is that for the first the girl who's doing the first time or selling her virginity or showing onl Nar hyf is the most popular porn star in the world 18 years old that's just her first time no that's not how it works I think the point here is sex is different than all of these things sex has meaning and I think that going back though here's the other thing why we can't I'll I'll give you another example why prostitution it can't really be called if you consider it sex work you'd say it's a job like other jobs that are not the the most fun to do is that what the idea of a prostitute would be that if under the sex work Paradigm it's a job and there are unpleasant elements and like other jobs many people do it just so they want to get paid I wouldn't say that job is necessarily unpleasant I think everything has aspects of unpleasantness to it okay well I would say that what you don't think prostitution is generally an unpleasant job when you say prostitution probably I said prostitution yes probably in general I would imagine it's unpleasant job yes I would imagine in general but there are lots of jobs that are unpleasant and we don't treat it like other jobs so for example uh in other jobs the occupational safety and health administration OSHA has very strict rules when you come in contact with things like bodily fluids so you have to wear goggles for example you have to wear latex gloves a gown you have to minimize exposure to bodily fluids all the time but you could never apply those oosha standards to a prostitute who's expected to you know have urine and ejaculate and other things you know put in their face so you so you can't treat it like other jobs can you in regards to the bodily fluids thing that probably not right so it it seems very suspicious that if we were to go in and say okay well she's going to wear these goggles and this gown and the guy it can't just be a latex condom that's pretty insufficient you could spread HPV even still in the areas that are uncovered you you got to wear to to make it a job covered an ocean you got to wear like a big old diaper that like covers everything in latex in the midsection and that's the only time the sex acts are going to be allowed is if you make sure there's no physical bodily contact but you also stuff to do this with like a lot of rigorous testing prior to the action lot no because it doesn't matter the the OSHA regulation aren't just preventing the spread of definitely infectious liquids of even potentially it's the liquids themselves my point is just that if if you had a if you had prostitution as a job that actually satisfied standards for safe work apparatuses no men wouldn't go to that they would go to the illegal Alternatives because it's not about this being a certain job it's about acquiring a commodity in the bodies of women or men who are frankly treated like women all the evidence shows that when you do start treating it like a job STD rates go down condom use goes up so I'm just I I don't get how I'm saying what are those like I've heard studies that say that before and they're often misleading like there was one about Rhode Island for example that claim like oh well you know goria goes down so it it makes prostitution legal except chyia also goes up during this time these are often very cherry-picked they'll pick some diseases but not others to try to say that this is this is acceptable or not but when you compare for example when you compare Germany where prostitution has been legalized since 2002 and Sweden where the Nordic model let's just stick on the oan thing right fine well I'm just saying the get killed in Germany they don't get killed in Sweden okay for sports don't athletes sometimes come into contact with like blood and stuff like if you're a boxer or if you do MMA right and you minimize that and then you might no no no no wait they don't box in OSHA outfits right they don't have biohazard suits on also pornography is already in employment industry in the United States is legal are you telling me there are no o standards the bodily fluids that happen in mixed martial arts competition are incidental to the ACT you can get involved in you can do an MMA match or Jiu-Jitsu match or boxing and not come in contact with blood and you definitely won't come you know you won't come in contact with seen that's not going to happen well wait what's more likely to carry like different types of horrible infectious diseases blood versus seen do you know I don't know the answer to that I I guess it depends what it gets into but the point is that no that's not the point then I will answer it's still incidental the goal in boxing and and and MMA and things like that is not to cause abrasions and cuts and if those things happen there are rules the goal what do you mean you're literally trying to beat the other person up it's incidental you don't have to that's not incidental me punching them in the face then bleeding it's not incidental me punching them in the face but it's it is different though than what is going on in a sex act where somebody is ejaculating into somebody's mouth that's completely that is and there's no like we would have bandages to be applied and things to prevent the spread of bodily fluids in a sport which I don't know if that falls under OSHA as much that's a sport different than just so question do you think OSHA standards just don't exist for porn in the United States they don't exist for pornography don't would they wait wait hold on because pornography an employment industry in the United States does OAS them I I believe that it's completely inconsistent how it's treated compared to other Prof say inconsistent isn't there going to be a different set of Osha standards based on whatever the particular job is isn't that literally the point of Osha is to create guidelines for safety for doing jobs and I mean if we want to go back you say no what I didn't hear the question that OSHA is going to have a different set of standards for different jobs there's probably going to be different rules depending on your work environment right there are going to be slight variations but the just the basic rules of how we' apply these different jobs and different workplace regulations and rules just cannot be applied to quote unquote sex work going going to prostitution in terms of just quick because I don't want find word OSHA does have standards for pornography and they do apply to pornography and they work just regardless the standards that may or may not apply to to prostitutes today and and to uh sex workers today who are engaged in prostitution prostitution leads to very bad outcomes back to when we talk about data for prostitutes and so I think that's something I mean Trent talked about the correlation obviously between the increase in human trafficking but it's also harmful to the prostitutes themselves in addition to that okay I want to really go through I want to go through the data on this because if we're talking about the pr say a couple criminalizing let me just finish Jasmine let me just finish so I had on my Show recently a ex porn um actor named Joshua broom and he shared his story he was one of the top ranked or awarded porn actors at the time and he left the industry he's now happily married with four kids so his life wasn't ruined in the end he was able to change his life and he's now extremely fulfilled but he shared about how during his time in the industry which was six or seven years 30 of his close friends took their lives um because of the just extreme 30 of his close friends took their lives were these all porn stars these are people involved in pornography creating pornography so if I look up Josh's story he's got there are 30 porn stars around him that killed themselves correct yes okay and so that have you heard I've never heard that in my life okay in the archive of women's mental health there's a study that shows that 20% of prostitutes have suicidal ideation and in fact how many what of women wait wait what 20% is it like 47% have tried like antidepressant people who have sex for money the rates of post-traumatic stress disorder among these individuals are on par with combat veterans and think about how much suicide afflicts combat veterans and the statistic for that specifically though according to this study is that there's an increase in risk for suicide attempt of 41% % versus the average of 29% so that 10% increase for those involved in prostitution psychotic episodes 41% versus 27% HIV a 6% to 1% other STDs like hepatitis STDs 11% to 2% emergency room visits 44% to 34% so the reality is if now we're talking from the point of view of is it is sex work good or harmful excuse me for the prostitute it is very here's the problem you're never going to eliminate that women are going to do prostitution but we have all the data now let me finish let me finish now no it is though because you're not going to get there's always going to be people that are going to supply this and when we criminalize it or when we yeah and when we but if there was certain things that policy decisions that we could make that could decrease negative effects for these proes because there's over 42 million of them according to the data that we have and the studies show that decrim and legalized location so consistent improved condom use this is a big study 2021 in the quarterly Journal of Economics 7 work siiz censes at Four Points in time pre pre-m post announcement uh but still pre-m post Crim and 5 years post Crim not only show that STD rates go down for those people but overall in there's that society as well also the crime rates and the amount of violence perpetrated against the prostitutes both by police and by their clients goes up the more you criminal the question that we are asking ourselves today is sex work is sex work harmful is sex work bad and I just read data that shows that if you are involved in prostitution you are at higher risk for suicidal idation for you're at higher risk for um being and then also here's a study that talks about the higher risk of being sexually assaulted or rap being a lawyer increases your likelihood of substance abuse increases your suicide increases your likelihood of depression is being a lawyer bad we need professionals to defend us in a courtroom men don't need professionals to have orgasms they can do that themselves if they need it well said the problem is the point is sex work is not needed for a society the way that but it always going to be there it's always going to be there you could snap your fingers get maybe I would take that but we have to be practical like I said in order to say if something is good or bad you have to look at what happens if you try to come in and take it and all of the all of the evidence many that's not even a question we're asking about how to regulate or make it illegal Etc we're asking is it is it is it let me just finish we're asking is it harmful right and we're saying we're showing data and explaining that it is harmful you're you're saying well being an attorney can be harmful the position here is well you don't need we don't a society doesn't need sex work the way that it needs doesn't prostition athletes are universally hared let me resp and then your response to that as well it's inevitable there's always going to be something okay so he's being lawyer bad for the lawyer itself okay so my question is let meish please let me finish you let me finish you always interrupt me murder murder is inevitable it still happens even though it's against the law right rape sexual assault is inevitable it still happens though against the law the inevitability argument that something will still happen to some degree even if it's regulated restricted made illegal Etc isn't an argument for why it's good or bad and our argument today that the position we're taking is that this thing is bad so I have a question talking you were talking about how oh it's really bad for the actual sex workers and I'm saying okay being a lawyer is bad for the actual lawyer so my question to you is if the data showed that having sex work or having porn actually led to less violence in society and Le like if the data showed that then would it be good because you're saying we need lawyers if having sex workers the data did show that would that change your position no because we shouldn't exploit people just to make Society a better place okay we shouldn't treat people like Commodities we shouldn't do evil so good may come so like I have a question about keeping I don't understand how that doesn't apply to athlet when it when it comes well you're like for Fighters you're literally watching two people your analogy with how is that not commodification no your analogy would work if we actually had gladiatorial combat where people used to have in ancient Rome where somebody is going to kill another person and let's say you you figure out hey you know it turns out when we have Gladiator matches like violence goes down it's a cathartic release when people watch the I reject the analogy we're not I'm saying that when two people yes when two people we don't you don't need to make an analogy to my analogy I'm saying that very clearly two people fighting on stage we are commodifying their bodies they undergo severe physical trauma all of their health care or health lifetime uh outcomes fall dramatically right CTE among other things if an athlete hadum would agree that be outlawed why I'm very sympathetic to regulating uh professional football because of the rate of concussive injuries especially among minors so I agree with your point but the level of harm that a prostitute undergoes is Way Beyond what a lawyer underg goes even what a professional athlete under goes it's the mental harm on par with like a combat veteran or let me finish or for example the question I had for jasine was since 2002 where prostitution is legal in Germany how many prostitutes have been murdered do you know I don't have that data in front of me but I know it's 69 how many have been murdered in Sweden in that time I don't know I could we could go one and it was by a jealous exboyfriend because Sweden cuts the demand and makes it a bad place that even sex traffi real quick what is the population of Germany it's much large it's larger but how much larger like 10 times how how it's not 10 times larger what is the population Germany I don't know even if you control look it up yeah look it up even if at least five times larer even if you control for the population differences that are involved no sex worker has been killed by a client in Sweden since they established the Nordic model in 199 83 million by the way none okay so it's like N9 to 10 times larger than isn't Sweden like 9 million or something wa wait real quick real on this athlete thing okay I'm going back to this okay 10 million if you want to compare athletes to prostitutes yes that's not a fair comparison we could compare Street Fighters you did it no no no no hold on you're saying that prostitutes have these negative outcomes in athlete Stone athletes would be the equivalent to like a brothel that's legalized if you want to compare prostitutes to Illegal athletes you'd look at like Street Fighters or something I think that the outcomes of no but it's the the studies show the harm among prostitutes even in places where prostitution has been legalized and pro and brothel are allowed you still have the mental health effects you still have the physical effects you have people that have anal muscles being torn out of them because they have sex with 10 guys in a night nobody I'd rather do MMA with with I'd rather have m punch me in the face do that the cas that I brought up of Joshua Brom and his friends they were not even prostitutes they were in the porn industry that's awesome okay so horrible and that's the point I mean okay suicide the question is because of Despair connected to a lifestyle that's living out of reality of using your B body and constantly abusing your body that's the that's the problem here okay wait wait okay we if you are saying um I just want to get this statement to CLA you're telling me that the outcomes for prostitutes that work in legal brothel is the same as the outcome for prostitutes that work outside in illegal areas that they're the same yeah no that's not what he said he said I'm I'm just saying that they're that they're negative they're worse than other occupations okay so then are the outcomes of prostitutes that work in brothels better than the outcome of prostitutes that work outside of BR we don't know because the you're not even going to make an educated guest you have no idea we don't know because the circumstances of brothel in different countries and different regions some of them are tightly regulated and have different behavor I'm saying one city in one area you're telling me that you think that prostitutes that work in Legally regulated brothels have the same outcomes as prostitutes they the same they have different degrees different degrees of outcomes probably one might be more likely to have substance abuse than the other but it's still higher it's still higher than the general population okay you do not when it comes to data you guys are not like this is associations between sex work laws and sex workers Health a systematic review amend analysis of quantitative and qualitative studies demonstrate sex workers who have exposed to repressive policing including the Nordic model where significantly more likely to experience violence from clients than others there's a lot of studies that show this the Nordic model increases violence that's not true in in the in the Nordic model for example it showed that certain acts of violence increase like hair pulling or slapping but other acts of violence like rape actually drop by 50% drug use is more frequently reported in studies from criminalized and partially criminalized settings which would be the Nordic Model A study explicitly comparing Health Service access between decriminalized legalized and criminalized settings experience the poorest health and safety outcomes with greater investment in health promotion prog programs and occupational health and safety measures in decriminalized and regulated settings so you guys do not win the data war on if criminalizing sex work we're talking about criminalization talking talk model is better I'll you another model is not better outcomes to sex workers you cannot argue that the Nordic model is helping sex workers more than de a 2003 study by Farley at all in seven countries showed that 89% of prostitutes want to quit their job but can't because of financial reasons same bet if you look at janitors and and people who scrub toilet do you have any data on that that they that they don't want to work I I can probably find something what the job satis let me put it this way is it bad that so if somebody wants to stop doing something and they can't so it sounds like we have women the majority of them want to stop having sex with men but they can't it sounds like we're facilitating rape on a mass scale then I don't think that's rape right I'm not saying that there're are prostitutes who would someone is no no no if someone's a prostitute who feels like they need to do this for money and they can't quit cuz they need that money and a man comes and pays to have sex with them you don't think their consent has been infringed no I think that yes sex workers I'm sure a lot of prostitutes would rather be rock stars okay that's not the are they consent are they fully they're consenting just like somebody who doesn't want to make you a sandwich but doesn't have a choice is going to make you so when a Hollywood actress consents to the executive producer having sex with him because she's worried about losing the role that's not right that's completely different because she in with sex work you are saying hey this is my job I will have sex with you if you pay me how what do you so what how is that it's because these women don't it's not voluntary like well I'd rather I'd rather go somewhere else and make money they feel like because they can't get employment and or or because they have previous sex sorry previous prostitution and Drug convictions prevent them from getting other bur King if you were a prostitute you can't get you can't get a job in a lot of places that's why de is really great because in New Zealand where they did that the criminals records Clean Slate Act of 2004 sex workers can have past prostitution related offenses expunged from their records places where going going back to my example with the executive producer and the actress would you say that consent is something you can't fully have if the person you're having sex with controls whether you're paid or not no you can't consent you don't are consenting there because you didn't consent to that Arrangement what if she went into it expecting that to happen if you went into it consenting to then fine yeah but that's well it's often expected and no hold on hold on something being expected and something being expected are two completely different things well what if they went in there and they said this is part of what I want to do if they said on your contract you can write this you can do that blah blah blah and you also have sex with this guy then that's a lot to have sex with a secretary or not not even a boss loading so hard B Because secret doing a question hold on I'm not dodging question secretar don't sign you're not you're not listening to what I'm saying I didn't even ask the question I didn't even get through to the question because you we could pick another example like an audition where you're not currently imployed and the director says yeah I want to get you in this movie but you know I got to see if you really look the parts you know if you can really pull off these sex scenes and so she's not employed yet but she would really like to get this job and really needs it there's certainly coercion and we would say that that's that's rape right there if everything is broadcast out in the open and it's like part of share you can say you can say that it's scummy or it feels wrong or whatever but is it coercion no you're walking into there you're accepting the job you're likeing okay it I'll do it like if that's something that comes like at the end of the process like oh by the way you got to me oh by the way you got do this then yeah you can say that's coercive so you think it's acceptable for a boss to um make a move on a employee provided the employee consents and his during the like during the interview process why would that be wrong do I can explain consent to you if you I guess cuz you're religious you don't understand it so the reason why it's wrong is because consent can't be negotiated between parties that have power over you but what if you went in there with the analysis that this might end up happening in this might end up happening is not this is part contract we understand we understand consent because you're us you're polyamorous you don't understand the danger expl I have to explain I have to explain I have now we've seen what's happened from that I have to explain okay no you went after us I'll go after you no no hold on you're asking me why can an employee not consent to having sex with a boss the reason why you can't do that is because you cannot determine if consent exists there because you don't know the employee say let me finish you don't understand the topic so let me finish okay the employee doesn't know the employ then stop trying to cut me off and I'm trying to explain something the employee cannot consent because the employee doesn't know if they say no if they're going to get fired that's why you can't have consent between people overpower but if the job says you have to do X Y and Z and Z is having sex that's not of the same type of consent as in the middle of a nonsexual job your boss is trying to get you to have sex but to Trend scenario if you're going into this and it's a scene that involves sex scenes and and the boss says this is what something we're going to do to practice the sex scene would you consider that a problem if it's advertised as part of the job then no if it's sprung on you and you weren't expecting it then yes sounds like Harvey win SC should just been more forthright then yes unironically yes we we can compare podcast we can compare podcast on the podcast world if there was a podcast and the guy brought on women and the guy brought on women no that was the problem the issue if there was a if there was a if there was a movie studio and the studio says we've got a producer and he'll make movies but you got to him to do it would that be scummy yeah of course would it be kind of like slimy maybe une kind of weird or whatever sure but would it be like non-consensual no you're signing up for it you literally are saying okay I'll go and I'll do making it scummy and bad I'm sure it's injuring consent in some way I think it's scummy because like a guy having sex with women in order like get them job is kind of like a scummy thing but it's a not a reason that's just an opinion it is that's what scummy is scummy is an opinion it's also scummy if you said you have to strug my toilet say that that sect Act is bad because it makes you feel bad I didn't say it was bad I said it was scummy yeah so is that a is that a term of a negative moral evaluation it's like a it's like a moral non-cognitivist position of like this act that's just like yeah it's not like a it's not like a strong statement on if it's unethical but we can say nonon a problem with it I don't know if you have a problem it's just scummy just like if someone said oh you have to scrub my toilets in order to get this job and in order to get this job that has nothing to do with sex but it's still really scum it's not acceptable it has nothing SE no they're both exploitative that's exploitative of cheap labor that's un you know not related to an acting role and the other is sexual exploitation all forms of all forms of Labor are exploitative nobody would work if they didn't have to and I thought you weren't a communist no but using your definition all forms of Labor are exploitative nobody nobody wants to be a janitor nobody wants to work at McDonald's nobody wants to yeah no one wants to make you a sandwich a Subway like it's it's all exploitative right if those people had other Alternatives they wouldn't do it no I think a lot of people who choose SE choose it because it's the best differ when you work at McDonald's or even if you work as a janitor there's tremendous dignity and honor in that work to you yeah what you do is something you're proud of that you can even a janitor can bring their kids and say hey look at this Timmy it's all clean and great your old man did a good job I doubt you'd want to bring your kids to bring your kids to work day for you I don't have kids what if you did I doubt they would you do bring your kids to work I if I ran a casino or if I ran a bar and there was drunk people everywhere I wouldn't take my kid into the bar with me either that doesn't mean me being a bartender or me running a bar if you run a bar that has a bunch of drunk people you're actually doing something wrong bartenders should not facilitate open drunkenness on their property even a casino that's something that's fine but I I think that this is very this is once again sex work is is not work it's not and it's not good and I mean if you're an obstetrician or a gynecologist would you want to bring your kids to work to show the vagina those are sexual organs that have part that because they're sexual organs you should no you should just keep sex away from kids and you might show them the hospit if you run a dispensary should you bring your kids in no one's doing anything wrong I'm just buying weed it's legal is that something you want to bring your kids into that's not necessarily wrong I think you can treat uh it would depend on this however I think that if you are concerned about a child adopting a behavior that could be destructive to them whether it's alcohol or marijuana then you might not show that to them but I think that shows that it's not great for your position that there is something destructive in some way about pornography and prostitution you wouldn't want to bring your kids to see it there's something damaging I think the other thing that's just so sad about the conversation is we're we're you know getting down into these different cases of how horrible these different things are by degrees and I think the qu the reality is sex is a good thing sex is a beautiful thing sex is an amazing thing and the problem the fundamental issue that Trent and I have been proposing here about sex work being harmful would you bring your 8-year-old to see you have SE just so let me finish it commoditized it it objectifies the people involved it takes sex out of the context where sex belongs which is in love and I believe in marriage you said this like but my point is that okay you just said that bringing your child to work because sex work is bad would you bring your child in while you and your husband have sex of course for the reason the same reason re SE is bad but that's you just said that my child the reason that it's bad is because I wouldn't bring my kid in to watch me have sex you wouldn't bring your kid in to watch you have sex in this great loving wonderful proper use of sex either that doesn't I'm not doing work when I'm having sex with my husband I'm expressing love I'm not being paid by him I'm expressing love so then why why bring your child in there because it sex is private between two people that's how it's designed and that's what it should be I me and that's that's one of the reasons why pornography is so harmful and one of the reasons why sex because because we can confidently say exposing children to sex is bad just is because they're that's something their brains are not prepared to maral sex though even exposing that to marital sex between the people not I don't think it's a good argument to say that because children can't come with you to your porn site children the point of asking that question and TR going along that line of reasoning was to show there is a difference between the work of the noble work of being a janitor and I would say to look down on people who work in a fast food restaurant or look down on a janitor to say that they just want to get out of the job is a horrible job yeah there difficulties but to say it's a horrible job there's nobility to that work there is not nobility to selling your of your body to someone else your morals there's this is Noble this is morality around sex there's morality around sex and you would even agree with that you would even agree that there is some morality around sex would you not is there what do you mean yeah of course there's some morality there's some morality around janitor there's some morality to being a right you have there certain regulations so far the only morality I've been able to ascertain from both of you is that there should be consent between two adults is that the only morality that you believe exists around sex that's a huge starting point yes is that the only morality that you believe exists around sex I I can't answer yes to that because I'm sure we can think of some exceptions or there might be some other qualifier well youve thought about it a lot clearly and we're at this debate yeah but if you're going to ask me hypothetical like what if you have sex with somebody it causes the fusion of two atoms and a hydrogen bomb exp I don't know in general I think most most I think most morality is going to be built around a reciprocation of consensual respect for other people yes how about consensual incest among adults how if you want to do it if you have a really hot sister then go for no harm not reproduce I have a question related to that so incest is okay I got a question and beastiality is okay speak say I don't think we should be doing any of those harm to animals an animal's consenting then BC is okay but I don't think an animal I think I would rather live in there's no way there's no way for the animal to consent just like there's no way for a child to consent Trent was trying to be like oh but we do all these other experients on animals we shouldn't do that I think and you said oh which one's worse it depends it depends some of the experients we do to animals are horrible we literally take out their ovaries we do all I would rather I would rather if I was you know I think sometimes even having sex with animals is better than some of the we do to animals like moving their ovaries around killing them literally killing them in order to does a dog consent to being trained what does a dog consent to being potty trained wait a minute are are you saying you're saying that sex with animals is not as bad as killing them what do you mean I sex did you just say that killing them is worse I think killing animals is I don't it depends right it depends what you think say that one more time what do you want me to say just the way you said it wait like what did you say killing animals is worse than no I'm saying sometimes the experence you can buy The Bu yes I think probably generally yeah why what's the next question how could you possibly flip that do you disagree do you think that having sex with an animal is is worse than killing yes it is worse because because animals are non-rational beings that we can eat there's nothing immoral about that sex is for human beings and I'm sorry you guys you think the SE so you think the SE because we're not religious so you think that no you're note you're insane person so wait who is the sex worse for versus The Killing worst for are you just looking at the persective human and not the animal at all or who is it no I'm talking about the ACT you're reframing it as it what causes more or less harm no no you said sex for an animal is worse than killing the animal I'm asking you worse for for an animal I think I'm asking who wor Act of Killing an animal is sorry the act of sex with an animal is morally worse than the Act of Killing the animal so and the only thing that has any moral perspective in your eyes would be the human yes because not the only thing there are ways to treat animals that are immoral like animal torture killing them is it is it immoral it can be immoral to kill an animal if you're doing it for a Cru for a cruel purpose or an inhumane way cruel in whose judgement no let's say you're if you're stuck on a desert island and there's let's say that we're I would like to if you're stuck on a desert island and you I was I'm talking about stuck on a desert island it's very obvious like you're killing an animal to eat it for burgers because it tastes good and it feels good no the here's the example if you kill if you're stuck in a desert island and you find a wild pig there and you kill it to eat that's not morally wrong if because you want to satisfy hunger if you're on the island and it turns out you're just horny and you use the pig to satisfy that yes that is morally worse is it morally worse if you just hunt to kill an animal just for fun is morally worse than what then is it morally worse to kill an animal because you just want to hunt for fun than yeah two people go into the forest one guy's hunting with a spear one guy's hunting with his dick who's more immoral there the guy that stabs the pig and kills or the guys that runs theal and it which one is more imoral bigbe I'm asking no I want to answer I want to answer what's more unethical the guy hunting with a spear or the guy hunting with a dick the guy that throw this a spear more ethical to kill the animal than leave it is Gravely much more Gravely depraved to have sex with an animal than to kill it in a slightly is not question and the reason for that the reason for that is what the reason for that is that you want to eat the animal our is that our position is that sex with animals what this viad our position is that sex with animals is always wrong my understanding of your position is that it's only well potentially wrong because animal can't consent depends I asked you can your dog is your does your dog consent when you train him to uh use the go to the bathroom not any more than your child consents to it okay so you're saying that you can train your the dog doesn't consent to some things the dog you're you're saying the dog is a child and that's why it's wrong to have sex with the dog that's your say that if we're talking about consent The Way We Know It informed consent I don't think there's any evidence to show that a dog can give you informed consent but no back to my other example can kids work for the police can kids work for the police kids can't work in general no can dogs work for the police yes okay so it seems like it's a difference there you can place them in a dangerous life-threatening situation for the common good of society and we see nothing immoral about that what's wrong with sex with them they don't consent to work with working yeah they if they can't consent to sex they can't consent to work for the cops but we see they can work for the cops so why can't they do the lesser harm what's the Lesser harm sex having sex because they could die in their jobs in the police force I I mean if if there was some evidence out that dogs working for police officers and stuff was like really bad like that's the thing with animals it's really cuz we don't know what they're able what they understand what's good for them what's not good for them if there was evidence that working for police officers was really causing a lot of harm to dogs then I would say that's bad we shouldn't have them so you need a social uh you need a scientific paper to tell you whether it's good for animals for people to have sex with them I just said it's not I never said that it's good for I just said that I just said that there's a lot of up you said oh well there's all this up we do to animals we should do why not have sex with I'm saying we shouldn't do any of the up to animals that's my position what's inconsistent about that let's say hypothetically there's a small handful of dogs who die in the line of duty there's just like the most dangerous job is logging Should humans not be able to toog but the point of where we're the point the question here is why is it okay to employ a dog without their consent but to your point consent is important when my point is that we shouldn't be doing a lot of animals I never said that having sex with them is okay I also said that testing on them testing the limits of your moral belief and what I'm saying is you're saying it's okay for dogs to work what is what are you saying that I disagree with what are you saying that I disagree I just don't understand what you're saying can I finish my question you're saying that it's okay for a dog to work for the police even if there's maybe a teeny bit of harm but largely speaking you don't want them to be harmed but it's okay for a dog to work for the police but it's not okay for a dog to do sex work for for a human being yeah because they don't consent for sex work they don't consent for work to the police so why would it why is it it's not all about with sex work it's all about what so you're saying that because we allow dogs to work ask you a question I'll my position is this if there is any action that we're doing especially if it's not producing a good to society because I think that does you think that sex work produces a tremendous good you keep talking about how good it is so if let's say that there are people that enjoy sex with animals and there are people who enjoy sex with animals and your argument so far is it's not okay we don't need we let me just finish it's not okay cuz the dog doesn't consent the dog does not consent to work for the police why is it not okay for a dog to do sex work because I think that when you're talking about working for the police those dogs actually their lives are better A lot of what time what if they're doing what if they're treated like a king in their sex work job if no that's the thing if I had any evidence that having sex with these dogs is something these dogs enjoyed and liked I would say it's fine I don't know dog dogs seem to get pretty they seem to get pretty humpy about things that's the thing I'm I care about the harm to the animal that is my position my position is to or if the yes if if this is my this is my thing if we can show that there is a harm to the animal being done then I would say it's bad this is my position if we can show that there is no harm or that the dog enjoys it or that the dog is better off if we could show that that was what's going on with beastiality so you are okay with fality as long as it appears that the animal en I didn't say it appears that's the problem is that as long as that animal orgasms I didn't say that either well what then how then how I don't think right now that's why I said I don't believe I don't think we should do Beal right now because we have no way of knowing I don't think orgm because people orgasm when they get raped too that's not a good way deter whether for the police officer in general it seems that he does if we're looking at what seems he does in general when we're looking at when we're looking at what is a dog like what what things can a dog have that makes it seem like their life is better and if we there was any way to show that if you them all the time and they're enjoying it and it's making their lives better I would say go for it doesn't have to well it doesn't have to be penetrative beastiality we understand the immorality of it even things of you know when the dog um arouses a person's genitals things like that and I'm not pulling this out of thin air like I said earlier there Peter Singer a famous philosopher was sharing this and defending it on his Twitter he's a world famous philosopher this is not and when you search for this stuff you find it everywhere people might say oh it's why are you bringing up this Fringe thing why this Fringe thing well look homosexual pornography was probably Fringe 80 years ago and the reason another reason why consent is such a um is such a weak foundation for sexual morality as it's whole whole you know saying oh as long as there's consent we're good is you can chip away at it from every other angle too and animals we just went through this exercise but we can chip away at it for children I mean we've drawn this line 18 17 16 do you have any arguments for adult consenting adults or is it all children and animals that you have to go to we I've made arguments several times and you you said it again about why sex is not just about consent sex is about so much more than consent sex is about love sex is about intimacy and sex is about the PO children bring life into the world so but that's for what's your that's for how sex is designed Jasmine whether you like it not that was the way it's designed and that's the way it's supposed to work then we're going all be Dev Destin admitted this earlier saying that's the design of sex even if it's a design of sex sex inevitably can bring about emotional connection of course it can bring about that but it inevitably also it can it can I agree that it can but it doesn't have but it doesn't have to if this was the design then there wouldn't be so many people that want to deviate from it and do if this was just design right we didn't just malfunction and deci actually I don't want this this isn't out for me let me try these other forms if this was the way it's designed right food is designed to for us to eat we don't you know use it any other way the reason we use sex other that's like saying our bodies are designed for example to have a certain amount of salt and sugar probably uh but think about it tons of people eat way more salt and sugar than their bodies were designed to handle because we live in a time when salt and sugar and fat we have ACC we too much in excess yes and I think pornography if you use it in a way that impacts your life then you shouldn't do it if you're Catholic you probably shouldn't watch porn the results seem pretty bad you care your doesn't mean that doesn't mean that porn is bad just like the dut and the bag of chips is not bad because in moderation it doesn't seem to have these effects where same thing with porn When there's less than 5% of people that even report having these problems a lot of them tend to be religious and moral incongruence is a number one predictor of having these issues those people shouldn't use it doesn't make the actual thing bad yeah I don't think it's about being religious per se or not I think it's about human nature huge but that has a huge imp has an impact because typically relig that's human nature then how come such a small percentage of people have an issue with let me finish typically people who are religious try to ascertain and live by a certain moral code that's more than just make sure there's consent okay and so that's where you seem to have a rub and you're just saying well they're just religious no they're people that have taken the time to understand themselves and try to understand others to say more than consent is what's good for me you and Society the position of Trent and I I would have this position even without being Catholic and before I became cathol this my question is the vast majority of people can have actually probably less people than when you look at porn can enjoy processed foods can enjoy all this in moderation it doesn't affect the vast vast majority of people are consuming porn and you can't show me where it harms them because you think sex is is beautiful and between two people but that's not an answer I want to know what the outcomes are if the majority time yeah and we actually I have we could SP a lot more you actually made our point that people do they they're not dying from processed foods but if you look at the average American who's eating them they're really suffering from a lot of things from negative Health rates they're not dying much the same way to say that pornography and prostitution is bad for society it doesn't have to make you a debilitated wreck that can't do anything you're just less healthy when it comes to sexual so the average porn Watcher is less healthy in what ways like where are you getting this how are they stud of the 22 studies that showed that there's an increase in aggression for younger people who I have a study that a study that shows that 20% of all relationships consider a point of conflict the porn use of one of the partners 20% Rel stud of the prostitutes involved in the prostitution industry and the harm that they experience if I show 30 of his friends committed suicide Psy like I've never heard of someone who has if 30 of your friends in any industry commit suicide I don't know who you're hanging it sounds like a very broken industry and that's unfortunately the pornography industry today or he was a secret Russian assassin I do need to uh read a couple chats and I think we have to wrap up here pretty soon so we had a chat here from legate Jr hey thank you thank you man for Team D Jen if the number of people identifying as sex workers increased by 5% every year for the next decade would you say that we would be dealing with a social contagion would sex work still be good or at least not bad CH Nation for life so I mean there's been actually a middle class shift into sex work like I think even I'm like an example of this except even I'm like there now that it's become safer and it's become more accessible more people are doing it and I'm not seeing that causing more harm in any way if you look at I I don't see any data showing that since the proliferation of porn especially since only fans that it has led to any negative outcomes other than like podcasts like this bring a lot of us on I think that as more people enter the sexual Marketplace so while only fans you say like it's safer yeah you're not you're not directly under the thumb of a pimp or something like that but as more people enter the camming market there is a pressure there similar to what we see among YouTube content creators that you have to do more uh outrageous things to get attention because there's more people in the marketplace vying for that attention and so there's a pressure not made from a pimp but the pressure of other people on the marketplace to do more sex acts that are about this yourself jine one of your interviews that you had Fairly recently you talked about how you're asked to do these scripts that seem odd and that involve a but that's that was from the beginning too and actually I do less of those things now but you're being you've been asked there's no evidence that people that want to join only fans are now feeling pressured to do because let me tell you as someone who's a very successful only fans creator that started from nothing the goal is just exposure getting on different social media and getting lucky it's not like oh here's a video of me the most popular only fans creators aren't super popular because they're like hey watch me have sex with a horse now and that's what made me super popular no what makes them what makes them popular is still things like you know being able to insert an entire fist in the anus I have I a top 1% only F Creator I have never done anything like that the top only F Creator you know amaranth I think amaranth I don't I could be wrong I don't look like her sh she hasn't even shown a nipple has she a lot of the top only fans creators actually just do solo work nothing that crazy I have never done anything that crazy I do people do that I'm sure some I'm sure some people do but I don't think there's any any in the most successful people only fans do the most do you do you expand your anus for clients because that's something they get off on saying they ask me I say no all the time especially as I make all the time is the point here so you on your YouTube channel that you do that that I spread my anus I mean I can spread it but for instance a lot of people ask me to do butt plugs toys I have never in my life done that and that's not because I don't think it's a moral I understand in a are many girls that don't necessarily have the more popular thing to and none of the popular only fans creators do it then I don't understand how this there's many there's many women and girls and men and boys involved in trafficking certainly pornography maybe not it's so hard to do trafficking on only things you literally have to have a bank account can I finish and they are uh exposed to and exploited to very degrading act actions and activities and so that's the that's the point that we're making is that there is an appetite for that and these things and that's why only fans is so great because you are in complete control of what you say to do and not do and when you look at the most successful only fans creators they are not the ones doing these most intense things if you look at them actually L of I understand that but I don't think there's any fear that they can't have a in certain things like even the Nordic model has led to people being like I don't have time I can't negotiate now my circumstances because it's it's basically I think you're living in a in a bubble of unreality you are one of the very simp you one of the very few of creators that can largely call the shots and many women though involved in exploitive sex work involved in both in this country and internationally are not the shot caller there you have it here we got two more chats and we do got to wrap up here pretty soon we have dog shite poster 69 if people need to use artificial devices to prevent pregnancy condoms pills Etc then obvious sex is primarily designed for reproduction okay okay there's a comment there and then we finally have pulling it up here in just a moment we have ibben Pro is forcing an electrician to wire your house at gunpoint equally as bad as forcing a uh sorker to sleep with you at gunpoint why why not and we'll this will be our final thing I think I think um a criminal code would say it is worse uh forcing someone uh to you know to do something I think for example that we have an entire category of sex crimes we don't have eating crimes have breathing crimes the fact that we have sex crimes that a rape that is done when someone is unconscious and they don't they it doesn't cause pain is treated worse in the law than maybe simple assault that does cause pain to a person because sex is just a very very different thing than any anything else well and it's the same reason why if you tap someone on the shoulder in the workplace that might be seen as a normal activity hello are you there if you tap someone on the crotch it's sexual assault there's something clearly different about sex and and using your body for sex and then other things like you know electrical wiring or whatever it is we have Aaron Martinez here fake lawyer maybe now you are refusing the crazy degrading stuff but as you hit the W as you hit the wall and it's coming fast and your money stream runs dry you will I don't think so I mean I'm pretty sure I mean I make seven figures a year if I was if I was two years you're only two years in yeah and I've made more money than I could have made in a decade in law so I probably what's more likely is I'll retire by the the time I hit the wall and I'll live out my life like and I know I get it I'm privileged but this is always just like a dumb AR again the argument the argument that I should be working as a lawyer for 50 years but this I only have a few years like saying professional athletes when they hit the that's not the argument about what you should do whether you choose between how much money you make as an attorney or an O the question is is sex work good for society or bad for society I don't think there's any evidence that it's bad you just said you're very privileged your case is extremely unique yeah but that was that was that was me I know so again living in on the reality of that there are many many many many other women and children and even boys and men who are experiencing not what you're experiencing experiencing what the statistics bear out in the pain of both prostitution and pornography but that's the thing there are a lot of people who choose sex work because it's the best option for them and they don't want to do those other jobs majority of sex workers they're doing sex work because they don't want to work another job or they don't have access to another job taking this away from them it's not going to that was the case of my friend Joshua broom he wasn't able to get the jobs he was looking for in Hollywood and so he got stucked into the porn industry that's a tragedy not a success story of course I would rather have everyone who's doing porn to be as lucky as me and that's what they want to do but the reality is people take jobs that they can get people always take the best job that they can get and for some people that is sex work just like for some people a lot a lot of people a lot of people would I thought you said Joshua Bloom was a success story no the point was he wasn't successful in Hollywood you said you said a tragedy not it sounds like a success story doesn't he have a family he's happily married porn industry he almost killed himself while staying in the porn industry what if he wouldn't have gone a Dr he would have actually killed himself which one do you think was better I mean I'm glad he left and he lived no no let's say that he would have killed himself because he couldn't find jobs or became homeless and got Mis understand his story no I'm not misunderstanding I'm asking Joshua broom if he had a Cher the porn industry he struggled to make it as an actor in Hollywood you said it seven times now I know 30 of his friends K themselves I know horrible epidemic of suicides around him I'm asking you what if instead of getting a job in the sex industry what if you would just been homeless and got addicted heroin which one you think would better hom addicted saypo homeless or sex work are think that if someone is forced into sex work Destiny because otherwise they would be homeless and on heroin that is another reason why sex work is bad for society and we should instead work on helping people work homeless we all agree here I think all of us agree here we're all which one is worse though which one which one is worse both bad they're both that's not an answer to which one is worse so they're equally bad sex is work because by what measure do you think if Joshua blon would have become homeless and addicted to smack do you think that he would have had the same chance of finding a wife and kids or I know people who are former Dre you didn't answer the question all you said like well I know or I feel I I'm just asking question silly even if it is worse that doesn't make sex work I didn't say I just wanted to know if you can even admit what are you trying to prove this thing is I'm just well it should be an easy question answer you're sitting here saying like do you think it's ethical to have a simulated child pornography being masturbated while you get eaten out by a horse and youed your shot at saying what's worse being a hit man or being homeless I can answer that question we I can engage that wor child sexual assault material is everywhere so it's not this Rand I just curious you could answer the question what's worse being homeless and addicted to heroin or doing sex work I just curious you answer that I think they're both har I think I think it's a worse crime to be raped than it is to have to be homeless yeah and I consider it raped because the exploitation of that's well said let's do this um why don't we each give you a one minute closing state and then we're going to wrap up the show Trent you start then lla then Jasmine then Destiny and then we're going to wrap closing statement uh I'd like to thank everyone for being here today uh man this was Des this a lot more animated than last time I blame the girls on that one uh but uh Destiny started animation today well it was it was it was uh I think it was I think it was but you know what um I I think ultimately what I would want people to consider from this to to go and look at at the data and just to ask if sex work of prostitution and pornography are bad for society look at what it actually is not an illusion of what it is go online go and look at the most popular search for things on porn PornHub xHamster camsites what prostitutes say that women so what prostitutes say that men usually request from them it's violent degrading and so it takes sex and it cheapens it and makes It ultimately meaningless and so then it loses its power to be that amazing bonding force that unites people together and create a new human life like sex it makes a new person so of course it's going to attach people together intimately we don't want therapists and doctors having sex with people sex is designed to attach people because when a baby is born it's really good hey if the people who created this child are bonded together in some way and sex helps to do that but if you turn sex into work it destabilizes the important role it plays in society and it leads to degradation abuse and all the things that we've that we've listed and that's why I think people should see past the illusion to see the ugly reality of it so and I would say of course I think sex work um pornography prostitution is bad for society it's bad for everybody involved I think the data not just show not only shows that but people's life experience shows that I think many people today are dissatisfied with their dating relationships marriages struggle um we've talked about the mass use of pornography and porn consumption and porn addiction I know that's a word that you guys don't like but porn addiction in addition to child sexual abuse material proliferating all of this and I think that's the consequence of forgetting the beautiful design of what sex is for and disrespecting and cheapening sex and I think that we should actually Elevate sex and celebrate it more is not puritanical it's actually saying um reject that Viewpoint as well say sex is something that's beautiful and good designed for love designed to bring life into the world and that's amazing and to be celebrated and it's so sad that people's sexual experiences and their their orgasm is now being um caught up in all of the horrific social harms that we've been talking about at this table when instead they should be caught up in a beautiful relationship of love and that's what we're fighting for so I appreciate you guys having the conversation apologies for my cough during it and your patience thank you for your patience with it but I hope we can I I want people to be happy and people to flourish and I think if we we see sex as couples to have simultaneous orgasms Pope St John PA the writes about that in love and responsibility the idea yeah I mean imagine if we focus inste on healthy marriages and healthy sex and marriage and beautiful sex and marriage instead of doesn't have to always be simultaneous that's a plus wait do you think wait did you say can oral sex happen in marriage or is that not okay oral sex can happen in marriage I well you have to define those terms well I'll explain what I was going to Contin do with I believe my position is that provided it leads to um you know my view my faith is provided it leads to the ultimate um potential for procreative act but even if you even if you thought that oral copulation is fine in marriage it wouldn't follow your ethic would include paying for por agree with me on that to say sex work so yeah so I would just again thank you everybody for coming here I would just say that this isn't to say there are no harms associated with sex work this is just to say that just because there are some harms Associated just like with the Second Amendment just like with the first amendment when people societies that give people the freedom in order to um in order to like control their sexual lives the way they see fit to do better anytime the majority of the data shows that when you try to ban these things or when you try to restrict these things or when you don't see sex work as work it leads to more negative outcomes than good I would also say that um the way the sexual repression and and you know those types of things seeing sex is this thing and then anything outside of that is supposed to be bad and terrible does lead to negative consequences repression doesn't seem repression causes a lot of the same problem people say porn does like erectile dysfunction negative body image issues shame Etc um and if you look at like the states and the areas that consume the most porn it is the most religious states so this idea it's really fine and dandy to say sex should be this thing and no one should have it outside it's just not the reality the reality is people do seek out this stuff and people are going to do this and there are people who are going to be willing to provide it even if they would rather be rock stars if they had the choice so the question is how can we make it so that this thing is the least damaging to society possible and that is to accept it and to um not criminalize it and demonize sex outside of marriage whatever Destiny your closing statements yeah uh thanks for the conversation um we didn't really get to it but I think like um I feel like a lot of this conversation uh ends up grounding out in what we view sex as being for which we didn't really talk about at all because we kind of went into all the data on the stats um personally I think that even if the data in the stats showed that recreational sex was good I don't think that would change either of your guys' positions at all if if more people reported like happier sexual activities or if marriages St more people had more recreational sex I don't think that would change either of your positions um the thing that scares me I guess about somebody being critical of a like consensual based position figuring out of activities are moral or immoral is if they reject that framework and instead they go with what they call their own moral framework I think that very quickly you can get to a person saying well alcohol should be immoral there's no reason to drink ever does it really help and it leads to all these negative outcomes like car accidents and alcoholism and abuse and gambling is no good obviously you're wasting your money sugar is bad look at obesity rates cardiovascular disease killing everybody video games are horrible it's a waste of time for kids they should be playing Sports they should be doing things outside um there's like marijuana is horrible the Olympics are horrible the athletes are too young it does damage their body like I think we can get into this world we can very quickly say that all of these things because we can't trace like a particular good and we can look at all these negative outcomes we can say these things are bad I think it's better to look at a a healthier way to build ways that we can interact with each other in society I think that a consent based for where we consent to activities and if somebody wants to sell sex and they can do it in a healthy way and somebody wants to buy it they can do it in a healthy way I don't think we should get in front of that or in between that transaction and should let people conduct themselves the way that they want to assuming there aren't these Mass horrible outcomes happening in society that was beautiful that was beautiful thank you everybody for joining us okay guys last call hit the like button please on your way out thank you for tuning in tonight uh you could have been anywhere in the world but you're here with us we appreciate that uh thank you to everyone who super chats and donates and supports the

again 5:00 pm Pacific on Sunday oh I I do want to say one thing I want to thank you guys funny a different topic I do think it's interesting we didn't get a chance to have any common ground but I do think like between this table a lot of us have common ground like there's a group of people on the internet men who might say yeah the um promiscuity and these sorts of things it's okay for like it's the position between ours you're saying it's okay for everybody we're saying it's bad for everybody they're saying it's bad for women good for men I think we actually have common ground we all agree that that's actually a bad position so I'm sorry I just wanted to throw out there actually a common ground between us that that's an untenable position that they should we just tag on the extra 30 minutes and just talk about abortion but that's a teaser we might maybe we could have an even friendlier friendlier conversation about that and other things okay cuz a lot of people have been asking for another uh Destiny and abortion debate abortion debate yeah so I'll block out 8 hours anyways guys we'll be live again Sunday at 5:00 p.m. Pacific I might try to convince Destiny to do one-on-one
