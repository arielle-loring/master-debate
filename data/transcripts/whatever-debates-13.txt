What do you do at the ranch? I'm a legal cordon, which is the best uh way that I can say that on YouTube, I believe. Okay, got it. All right. Andrew, what about you? I want What the What is that? I don't know what that is. A cortisan. A woman of the night. Yeah, she's a woman of the night. Okay. At a a cortisan. Okay. A cortisan. Yeah. My name is Andrew Wilson. I'm the host of The Crucible. It's popular entertainment channel on YouTube. I'm a political analyst, a political satist, and I engage in conversations, debates all over the world, and I'm happy to have this debate today with you, too. So, I appreciate you guys coming. All right. Brian Atlas 35, host of the whatever podcast, washed up over the hill has been YouTuber. Uh, that's pretty much it for me. Um, all right. So, I guess we're um going to get into some of our first topics here. Uh, do you guys seem to have specific disagreements with the podcast? It seems. Do we Do you Is that That was my impression, but Oh, like me us with this podcast. Yeah. Yeah. Like the dating talk podcast. Oh, I mean I did initially, but since the last time I was on, I realized that you weren't that terrible. So, not that terrible. Slightly terrible, though. Yeah. What are the things I'm terrible about in terms of my views or whatever? I don't think that you're that bad anymore. Um, I think that just Okay. What about this guy next? Speak up a little bit, though. Yeah. Sorry. Um, I I guess our disagreements would probably be about the whole women's voting and some political stuff. Um, I think religion as well, it's kind of hard to disagree on that, but um, I think we could have a conversation about the morality behind religion. Sure. So, Sure. Uh, and then what about you? I don't have an issue with either one of you. We've never met or interacted. Um, my initial impression of the podcast was simply through clips I've seen on like Tik Tok and Instagram, but of course those can always be taken grandly out of context. Um, but after watching a little bit of it, it's a way different than I imagined. So, I'm happy to be here. Do you both describe yourselves as feminists? Uh, I've never described myself as a feminist, but yeah, I like women. Maybe a quick definitions like feminism would be the movement towards an egalitarian society deconstructing the patriarchy. No. No. So do you think women are an oppressed class? Not in America. Okay. I'd have to agree with her. Yeah. Okay. Not in America. Not in America. So there you think men and women have perfectly equal rights or at least women have as many rights as men? I would say so. Yeah. Same for you? I don't disagree. Okay. Um, and you don't categorize either of yourselves as feminists. Is that correct? I would have to say no. There's a lot of corners of modern feminism that don't like me based on what I do for work. So, that's kind of tough to navigate in itself. Sex work conversation. Um, and what what do you guys think about do you think there is a patriarchy? She she had an opening statement actually. Oh, really? You wrote I did I wrote Yeah, we can sure we can do that. All right. Um Okay. I said uh that I think morality should evolve with society. And I think that empathy is the foundation of a just world. And I think that Trumpism is rooted in division, cruelty, and a lack of accountability. And I think that religion is used to justify harmful and outdated beliefs, especially about women in other countries. And I don't reject the idea of high of a higher power, but I don't think that a text written by bronze age no nomads should dictate modern morality. Uh, and my stance on politics is about what I believe is right and wrong based on reason and empathy. Um, so I just would like you to consider whether it's truly moral or just convenient for maintaining power when it comes to religion. I see. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Do you have a opening statement or um I would keep it very brief. Uh I didn't write anything out. My perspective on religion religion is that I actually find it slightly delusional in most senses. Um I would consider myself an atheist to keep it simple. Um I actually grew up in the Catholic church. I know that's a little bit different from Christianity in some aspects. So that's totally fair. However, I think um whether you're questioning or unquestioning in your belief of a god in a traditional sense, I personally um find it unrealistic um and people don't question it enough. I think delusional is the best way that I can describe it. I'm interested to hear your perspectives because in what I've learned about you just in my research before this, I'm actually really interested um to talk to you and I am coming at this from a non-aggressive, non-argumentative way. I hope to portray that at least probably going to get pretty argumentative. Just not going to lie. And that's okay. It's probably going to be pretty argumentative. Uh you had uh views on immigration too, right? I had some. Yeah. Yeah. Let's start there. Uh, one really quick thing. I do uh I do want to do a quick secondary thank you to Ogle who popped uh a crystal ball for us in our debate uh just about an hour ago. So, do it again. Thank you again, Ogle. I I do appreciate your patronage. Uh let's Yeah, let's just get into the immigration thing now. What prompted that conversation in your last appearance? Um, so Mick, are you able to pull up the tweets, but can you go to the one that's about immigration? Do you know how to do that? So, uh, here, remember how I showed you, um, on the other monitor, there's going to be a bunch of tweets. And now, if you just minimize the Discord, can you show here, Mick, tell me what is currently up on the monitor, please? Okay. Can you minimize the Discord and tell me what you see on the monitor and then I'll be able to tell you where to uh navigate to. Sorry guys. Just uh Matt, thank you for the soup chat. Do appreciate it. And if you guys are enjoying the stream, like I said, $200 TTS read is 100. TTS is 200. Do you have it? Do Do you have the Discord minimized? Yeah. Okay. That is definitely not um Can you just pull up the Chrome tab? So, remember how it was visually before where it was everything? No. Okay. Here. Okay. Just stay there. So, minimize the Discord tab now. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Here, go up. I'm sorry. Yeah. Go up to the Discord box. Go up to the Discord box. And do you know how the minimize feature? Yes. Okay. Now, hit F11 on the keyboard here. Actually, before you do that, no. Here, hit F11 again. Okay. Um, click. Remember how I showed you the tweet? The tweet? No, no, no, no, no. the tweet beyond the Instagram tab like I showed you before the stream. Yes. Click on that one. Okay. Go F11. No. Uh yes. Hit F11. Okay. And then controll tab until I tell you to we get to the right thing. Next. Okay. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. What the Next. There was quite a quite a few. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. I apologize to the viewers. I know this is Okay. Next. There it is. Okay. This is what started the conversation as it pertains to immigration. Elon Musk on February 18th uh posted uh haha wow uh in response to the White House posting ASMR illegal alien deportation flight. Scroll down a little bit on this Mick. Scroll down. Okay. And to which you responded, "You have no empathy for men." Which led off to a conversation you and I had about immigration. Uh so are you in favor of illegal immigration in Didn't you say that morality is based around empathy? Yes, I did. So, wouldn't that be an immoral position? Or is it just a moral position because you don't have any empathy for this group of people? What do you mean? I said you have no empathy talking about Elon Musk just because I mean I'm not for illegal immigration. That's not something that I'm uh advocating for. But I think that posting in that way as if it's funny to um do that to people and just pick up their whole lives, I I don't think that that's funny. I think it's tragic. Um and I understand that we have to do it, but I think that it could be done in a in a better way that's not uh immoral. So you your problem was that he was just laughing about it? Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do have a problem with that. But I mean it is kind of ironically funny, right? Ow. Well, because if you break into my house, right, and then the cops come and take you out, I'm probably going to laugh at you, right? Okay. Would would you would you laugh at somebody broke in your house and then I do think that's a little bit different, though. But would you would you laugh at them? Sure. Yeah. Your empathy for them then? Well, I think that's a little bit different. Um cuz those people aren't breaking into my house to live a better life. They're breaking into my house probably for a bad reason, I would assume. Anyway, um well, I mean, it's a good reason for them, right? Like their reasons for breaking into your house is they want your stuff for a materially better life, just like the immigrant, right? Right. Well, I guess that's subjective based on scenario, but I um I I don't think that it's right to laugh about that in particular when it comes to immigration. H So, you're not for illegal immigration? I'm not. Uh, no. I I Well, obviously not. I mean, I don't think that It is what it is, though. You know, if if we could stop it, then I think that would be great. But that's just not I don't think that that's possible. I don't think that'll ever be possible. What about deportations? Is that okay? I think um I think that depends really for me morally. I think obviously criminals uh that makes sense. That's been in place for a long time. But I think when it comes to kids like in the Dhaka program that have grown up here and have never lived like in their home country and they don't speak that language, I think that deporting them is immoral. I think that's wrong. And I understand that it's their parents fault, you know, when they bring them over here. It's a selfish decision. But um to put that on the kids kind of just seems unfair to me. Doesn't it seem unfair to me that it's an it's an unfair situation all around. But so so how come this is what I don't understand about the empathy is morality crowd. I really don't get this part. You say well Andrew we really got to be empathetic towards these people and their plight. It's like but at the expense of me and mine. Where's the empathy towards me and mine? And then it just kind of becomes well their shit's worse. Right. Right. It's like but but but isn't there supposed to be empathy on both sides? I totally think that there should be. Yeah. Um I mean it's really hard to pick a side when it comes to stuff like this cuz um I agree with both of both of I agree with that. But um I think that the implications for deporting somebody that's lived here uh for their whole life and they don't speak the language of their home country versus you having to deal with that person in a Walmart. I feel like it's a little bit of a different situation when it comes to Well, I understand it sucks for them. Yeah. Like I get that they're going to have a lot of readjusting to do. You know what I mean? But for you know, not every DACA recipient is under that by the way. No, not all. But but the thing is is even for the ones who are right, if you are to this is then this is one of the big kind of like primary problems maybe we can dive into with your empathy's morality thing. What about looking forward 30 years? So it's like right now we can be empathetic towards these people, right? That's true. But what if you send the signal that this is now okay and so more illegals come in have children here understanding that well you know uh these kids in 20 years can make the same claim as the former DACA recipients and now we have to make all of them citizens as well. Bypassing all of the other people who are in line. Not much empathy for those people. Right. Right. And creating now a perverse incentive for more people to come and do it seems like it's the least empathetic thing to do. Well, what would your solution be then when it comes to deportation and legal immigration? I would kick out every single legal immigrant who was here and everybody here who wasn't a naturalized citizen. Okay. Gone. They have no business being in our nation. uh nation is from my perspective it's uh culture borders language that's how uh very famous talk radio host Michael Savage used to frame it I largely agree with that assessment culture border language so uh in this case um illegal immigrants who come in they don't have the same culture they often like even at the hotel I'm staying at half half don't speak English right and Um, and they've already violated the borders. So, like what from for me that's already criminal. So, when you say things like, "Let's deport the criminals," I'm like, "Well, there they are." Okay. They, right? They're already criminals from my perspective, right? They've already broken in here. So, when it comes to parents that come here, uh, and they have a kid here, though, and they raise that kid here, obviously, they made a choice to do that. That's a selfish choice because they they know that that could be a possible implication. Um do you still think that that's fine to Well, the law of the land is that um if you're born here, you become a naturalized citizen, right? So So that's not So that would be I want to repeal that. Okay. I would like for there to be a different interpretation that says that a naturalized citizen is you have to have a mom and a dad and both of them are native to the nation and then they have a child that child becomes native to the nation. That's I I would get rid of the soil policy alto together but that naturalb born would require your mom and your dad both be citizens of the nation and uh then you become a citizen. That's that's like my ideal citizenship policy. So when it comes to immigrants working here, do you not think that they are good for the economy? Do you think that they are harming it? Sure. Slave labor is good for the economy. Okay. It's different. Well, not really. So because because they have no documentation, they can be paid under the table. They send remittances back to their home nation, which is untaxed, right? totally untacked remittances in the hundreds and hundreds of millions if not I think it's billions actually that they send back in remittances but don't quote me on that it's at least hundreds of millions okay they're sending back to their home nations that's non-t taxable the employer is able to squeeze out American citizens for the jobs because now they can pay under the table right uh and then they do they do do work visa programs but they're totally rigged right so the work visa programs are totally rigged for um for various uh companies um the the whole thing is a massive cluster when it comes to that. So yeah, I don't think that that's good policy. I think that you're just kind of promoting slave labor essentially by giving people perverse incentives to have people come across the border and then they have children here and now we have a conundrum. Right. Right. Like oh what do we do now? Well, I definitely am not advocating for slave labor. I or people getting paid under under wage. I don't advocate for that. But just for an example, like let's just say that you have a construction company and you have a hundred illegal immigrants working for you. You're paying them under minimum wage and then we deport all of them. So, in what I think logically is I don't think that these businesses would be hiring a hundred American citizens and then paying them a just wage. I think that they would be spending the same amount of money but hiring less people which would just make everything less efficient. Then why don't we just bring everybody into the United States? Well, I don't think that's really an argument. It's not an argument. It's a question. Well, I am not advocating for that. That's not Yeah, but why not? If it just is going to perpetually increase the GDP and it's going to perpetually increase the amount of cheap labor that businesses can get, why not just bring everybody here or bring hundreds of millions a year here? But do you understand my point though? Like do you No, not Well, not really. You're just saying if you have a business and the business has 100 employees, right, and suddenly the business owner had to pay a fair market competitive wage, he would have less employees. That seems like it's the advocation again of slave labor. No, I'm not. I'm just I'm just saying that this is how I think it would go. I don't think that these businesses would hire American citizens at the same rate and pay them a higher wage. I think that it would be But isn't that isn't that why we want to get rid of illegals so that businesses have to hire our citizens at a competitive wage? But do you see how it would make things less efficient? And again, I'm not advocating for paying people below minimum wage, but unfortunately that is it is what it is. So just thinking about it in terms of that, would that not make it less efficient? Yeah. So I just if you want to understand the implication of your argument here, what you're doing is you're advocating on the on behalf of rich industrialists. So if rich industrialists can pay people who are not American citizens less money to do jobs that then they make more money off their back and they don't have to actually employ the American public, they gravitate towards that. You actually have created a perverse incentives a perverse incentive for illegals to come here, be secondass citizens and get paid less than the normal American, right? Like that seems totally like contrary to what you actually want. Well, I'm not advocating for that. I think that just thinking about it logically, like that's how these people run their businesses. That's why they hire illegal immigrants so that they can pay them less. Sure, people violate the law all the time in order to make more money, which I don't agree with, but I'm saying like would that not make things less efficient if you had less workers? Yes, it would make things less efficient if you had uh less workers. But however, this would could easily be applied to slavery. Ending slavery is bad because it would be less efficient because we would have less workers. Right. Right. I I do find a big distinction between slavery and illegal immigration though because those people are are here by choice. Sure. But the consistency of the argument is the same. So that that your value that you're arguing is about efficiency, right? So it's like, okay, great. Yes, it is more efficient, but also here's another scenario which would also be more efficient. Well, sure, but that's a comparison that just So, it seems like efficiency is not really what you're trying to argue. Then you must be trying to argue something else because if you take efficiency and you say, well, I think this will hurt the efficiency of the business. It's like so is taking black people out of cotton fields. That hurts the efficiency of the cotton field, right? Well, in in that scenario, in a in a slavery scenario, uh obviously I'm not advocating for that, but I think illegal immigrants, they they want to be here. They came here, they want to work, they want to make money. They're contributing to our system. So did slaves, but not by choice. And they're not getting paid. So that's true. But very big difference. Then the value here must be something not that's not efficiency. you must be arguing something that's not efficiency then because you keep on saying well it's less efficient it's like I can grant that but then that's just an example of uh how I think that illegal immigration has done something good for our economy whether I think it's morally just or not I think uh that you you can say that it's illegal immigration can be super helpful to the economy in some aspects but it can also be very draining in other aspects for the instance um the these people are not paying into tax the the um tax system for uh basic things like government subsidies for emergency care, right? It happens in emergency rooms. California had some of the finest hospitals in the world which were bankrupted by illegal immigrants using them basically as the emergency room as a health facility, right? Um there's all sorts of net drains also that they get including fraud for social security, fraud for stealing people's identities, all sorts of fraud that drains the system, not to mention remittances which aren't taxed. So the thing is is like if you're making the moral argument based on efficiency. I think that's not what you mean. You don't mean efficiency. You're just pointing out an example of how they can be a boon. Yeah, that was just But I would just agree. I would just agree there can be cases where they definitely help the economy. Okay. just they're just just in net even if you made the the case and I agreed with it that they mostly assist the economy that's not the only dynamic of the problem we're looking at right yeah definitely not that's just like just an example of um why I think illegal immigration has been good in some ways um sorry no it's fine uh go ahead like specifically where I live as Well, uh, where do you live? I live in Tucson. Oh, in Arizona. Yeah. So, it's right on the border. Um, and obviously we have a lot of illegal immigrants. Um, and the people who live in the border towns hate them. They sure do. Yeah, they sure do. Why do you think that is? Uh, because they got there illegally. Well, because they destroy their property. They um they butcher their cattle. They um they do all sorts of horrible things to their private property. They do a lot of thefts on the way over. It it they just loathe them. People in border towns are always always demanding more and more security inside their towns. They can never get enough because I mean you can imagine how unsettling would it be if you go out for your nice uh you know Starbucks frat or whatever it is in the morning, right? And it has the double shot of espresso or whatever the it is that that you know pe girls get now. Uhhuh. and you sit out and you're in your like little stocking whatever your your blanket and and you're on your deck and you look out and there's families of illegal immigrants crossing your backyard destroying Okay. I I'm sure that that has happened to someone. I've lived there for a very long time. I've never seen that happen. I've never heard of that happening. Um I live on the northern side. So Ngalas I think is it So not the border side. Yeah, not the border side, but Ngalas the crime rate over there is a lot higher, but I think that it's very um it's very community based. They don't really leave that the crime stays in that area. I think it's a lot of uh which is also bad. Crime. It's also bad. So, it's like all the arguments that you can make as a pro for illegal immigration, you just have to kind of bite the bullet that you want to concede our sovereignty because that's what it does. It conceds our sovereignty. I cannot go to Mexico tomorrow absent paperwork to and work there illegally, right? And uh do whatever I want. I mean, you wouldn't want to though. But even if I There are tons of Americans who want to, especially rich ones because the the power of the dollar versus the peso is so high. If you're a multi-millionaire, you go down to Mexico, you can live the high life, right? Yeah. Mexican government though, they want their money. They don't want you to come into their country without sufficiently greasing the palms of the Mexican government, which then is supposed to trickle down to its citizens, whether it does or it doesn't. You can't do that with them. Why is it that we should have the expression they they can do it to us? Yeah, I mean, I agree. I'm I don't think that um I'm not I don't think that we should just open the borders and let everyone in, but I think that there are you have to recognize the pros and the cons. There are both. We can't just say that illegal immigration is bad period because they have Would you say helped the economy? Let me ask you a question. Would you say that slavery is bad period? Yes. I What about the pros? Well, the pros are very one-sided when it comes to slavery. I think illegal immigration there can Nope, they're not. Let me give you an example. Okay, so you have a two nations at war. One's an aggressor nation much larger than the smaller one, right? and they attack like let's say Russia attacked a smaller nation like I don't know Ukraine let's say okay right they attack and the Ukrainians and during a counterattack they're able to take over a large swath of Russia with tons of civilians who are all loyal to Russia okay they have three options option A imprison them right okay option B kill them or option C let them go so that they and continue to assist their enemy in making weapons to kill your side. Okay, those are your three options. Would it be more morally just to go ahead and imprison those people rather than kill them or have them run back to make weapons that were going to kill you? It's a tough question. I think um not really sure what I would do in that situation, honestly. Now, let's say you did imprison them. Okay. But you only got so much food and so much resources. You're fighting a war, right? Is it just then to have them assist against their will? I think I would let them go. You would let them go to assist the enemy in killing you. I I'm not Here's the thing. I I am not a war leader. I don't belong in war. I'd make bad choices because I don't want anybody because empathy. Because empathy. Okay, that's the thing, right? He's like, I'm what I'm giving you is an example of if you were to have two nations, they're at war. One's an aggressor nation, attacks a smaller one. Okay? It seems to me like they would be totally justified if they counterattack this other nation rather than letting their men go and continue to come back and fight another day to imprison them and then force them to work against their will. Okay. So, in that scenario, you would say that slavery is just. Sure. Okay. Wouldn't you? Well, I wouldn't go that far. I would say that maybe in that maybe it h it would have to be done, but I wouldn't be happy about it. Well, I mean, maybe, but you're not happy to be in a war. Well, no. So, what I'm saying is that there are just times to enslave people. Okay. And there's no if ends or buts about it. I don't see. And so, when people say like you got to take the pros and the cons of something, but then they make an unequivocal moral statement like there's no pros to slavery. It's like, yes, there is. I mean, but in in but there's way more cons why we shouldn't do it. I get that. Cuz it wouldn't that just be cherry-picking in a way? Which one? I mean, trying to find a good outcome of slavery when there are so many bad ones. Trying to find one good one just seems it's well, it's just it's just showing that the principle is not consistent. Okay, so like we're just checking the consistency of the principle. So I I bore slavery. Hate it. I think it's god awful. Okay. But I still need to be consistent enough to think, is it always under all circumstances, right, that are realistic? Like you can come up with bizarre hypotheticals where it's like, would you enslave two people to save the world? I Okay, fine. But that's unrealistic, right? What about realistic things that happen with slavery where you're like, actually, like if I was in that, I'd probably do that, right? And so I'm just checking for the the principle, the consistency of the principles. I mean that's it's tough uh cuz I I mean my moral is just I don't want that to happen in general. So that would be a hard situation for me to deal with. I wouldn't be happy about it. But I guess that would be uh the only solution. So yeah. Yeah. Empathy does not always provide the answers. No, it doesn't. But it can lead you down a good path, I think. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, I think one of the other disagreements that we had when we were discussing immigration was the question of feasibility. Is it feasible to deport the millions of illegal immigrants that are here? You had objections from a economic perspective. It's going to cost a lot to do that. And you also didn't believe it was feasible. Uh I don't know if you have more to add to that or Andrew, I mean, do you think that there's Yeah, totally feasible. Absolutely. We can deploy the United States military right to the border or shoot to kill. I would do it right away tomorrow. Wait, shoot to kill? Oh, yeah. The illegal immigrants. Yeah. It's our It's our No. If on the border if they're trying to cross I thought the ones who are currently here. No. No. No. No. Is it Isn't it wrong to kill though based in religion? It's wrong to murder. Is that not murder? No. Killing someone is not murder. No. Murder definitionally is the unjustified killing of someone. Okay. So if you can justify it, it's fine. If you have good justification for it, is that subjective? Can any can I kill anyone and justify it to myself? Well, I would consider justification Well, I would start with the idea of what justification is. Okay. And then with the idea of is it an objective or subjective justification? But either way, I would be justified. So if you say, well, there is no objective morality. It's only subjective, right? and it's relative between people, then you really can't give me any reason why I shouldn't do that. So, just example, somebody breaks into your house, you shoot them. Am I allowed to say that? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Um, that's justified. But you're walking down the street, you see a family of illegal immigrants, you don't like it, you shoot them all. That's not what he was saying. No, he was saying that would be unjustified. Yeah. If they're trying to cross illegally. Okay. So that they're trying to break in just like they're trying to break into your house that I would view it the same way. Breaking into the country. Mhm. Okay. Well, I don't have an argument against that. I wouldn't do that. Yeah. So, I understand. You're in favor of it. Am I? No, I'm not in favor of it. I I just personally wouldn't. Well, do you think that illegal crossings would significantly go down if the United States military was on the border and said if you try to cross the border illegally, we open fire? Don't you think that? Yeah. Yes. Well, then it sounds like I solved the problem. Okay. By not using empathy. All right. Well, then let's put that into play. I agree. Totally. I don't know. I don't know if I That's I haven't even thought of that as an a solution. I don't know if that's my position, but I would agree with you in so far as Andrew. It would be a massive deterrence. Yes, it would be massive deterrence. Okay. Just like nuclear bombs, right? Why do you have nukes? It's not to use them, right? Deterrence. It's to stop people from using them. So, the idea isn't actually to send them down there with orders to shoot to kill. The idea is that because they have orders to shoot to kill, they'll never have to. Okay, that's the idea. I mean, if nobody has to die. Well, we hope. Probably some will. Okay. Yeah, probably some. Well, I don't think that there is a like a flat simple way to fix the immigration problem. I pretty sure that would fix it. That's a way. Sure. I just um I think that would be really hard to pass. Yeah, that's true. I think you're correct that it would be difficult to pass through Congress an act of Congress which mobilized but well, you know, the president's the commander-in-chief though. He doesn't I'm not sure that that would be war authorization. So, I think he could actually unilaterally just order the military and order the border states to mobilize their national guard with orders to shoot. I think he actually could do that. Didn't he try to get the military over there, though? The military is there now. They just don't have orders to shoot to kill. Right. Unfortunately. Okay. Yeah. Well, he says unfortunately. What do you think? Is that unfortunate? Do you think it's unfortunate that they can't kill them? I don't think that that's unfortunate. I I don't I'm not advocating for the killing of anybody. Well, it's not an advocation of It's an advocation to make sure there is no killing. I believe in forced doctrine. So the idea of like the idea of 5 foot one men attacking 7 foot tall 300lb men doesn't seem that likely to me. It seems like they generally won't do that. Right. Right. So it seems like if you're a 7 foot 300 lb buff yolked out dude, you're probably not going to get attacked. And the whole idea behind that is because the person is worried that if they do attack you, what happens? They get they get messed up real bad. Right. Right. So, if you think if this is something that Trump could do, why do you think he hasn't done it? I don't I just don't think that he would be able to justify it politically. Okay. Why though? Because I think that there would be an outcry, a general outcry against it. And it could stress his powers. Like, yeah, I think it could be argued that this I I'm I'm not sure on this, right? But I it could possibly be argued as like you would need congressional authorization for this because of some reason possibly be they could defund it or there's any number of different reasons or there could be some type of like humanitarian crisis that it could be presented as that would cause a bunch of problems for him. So there might be a bunch of practical reasons, but I don't think that there's anything morally wrong with taking your army, putting it on your border, and telling people who try to cross that border that there's going to be dire consequences if they do. Okay. Yeah, I think that's totally reasonable. It's within the confines of reason. It's logical. It seems within force doctrine, it would actually prevent more crossings and it would prevent more deaths ultimately. Yeah. Well, I don't um I don't have a solution, my own solution when it comes to immigration. I think that uh topic is far too complicated for me and I don't know enough about how things work or politics uh to really come up with a solution. But I I think the only other disagreement we had pertaining to that was that there were uh flights, they were flying the immigrants in. You thought that this was dubious, that there was no evidence of it. you didn't think this was actually a thing. Um I don't know if you still think that's the case, but I I yeah I still think there were in fact flights hundreds of thousands illegal I don't know the precise number but there were Have you ever heard of the migrant caravans? The what now? Migrant caravans. I have heard of those. Okay. Yeah. So that's tens of thousands of people whose entire objective was to go through South America and Mexico collecting as many people as possible in order to break into the country at a single point make a political statement. The Democrats assured them that they would have hotel rooms that they would be taking care of. They actually had Democrat liaison who went to South America and would coach these migrant caravan leaders. Um it was a big cluster Yeah, what we were talking about is uh I I think it was I think it was hundreds of thousands of immigrants being flown over into New York. Um and I just Why would they do that? Because it switches voting demographics. But they can't vote. Well, that's funny to that's funny that you should mention that, but I'm not going to get into that on YouTube because of the terms of service. But, um, the thing is is they can't work either, but they work, right? Right. But voting is a little You need a social. You're supposed to need a social work. Okay. But to to sign up to vote though, how do you do that without social? You take your fake ass social that you got out of So what happens is here's what people do. They go to a cemetery, okay? Well, they don't maybe they don't physically go, right? But what they do is they look through obituary records for somebody like let's say your name is um Javier Vuarez, right? And uh you're roughly 25 years old. And so you go through the obituaries and you find somebody whose name is like, I don't know, uh, Rodrigo something or another, and he's 22, right? And he has roughly the same types of features that you do, right? You can apply, get a death certificate, you get the death certificate, and then you can uh manipulate that in such a way to get a birth certificate. You take the birth certificate down to the social security office, say, "I lost my social security card." They give you back your social security card. Then you go get a normal real state ID. you have now assumed somebody else's identity. Are there statistics that show how many people that have passed away have voted in this last the problem is right is like they don't one they wouldn't count them as passed away because this is an active person who's not dead right but they did die though. Yeah, they did die, but that doesn't mean that they've been officially counted. One, and two, when you're talking about the uh assumed identification, uh they can also they're also going to be counted as a living person. You can have conflicting records inside of our recordeping, okay? You know, apparatuses. And this happens often. Now, how many there are, liberals will tell you that there's very few cases like this, but it's very, very difficult to determine how many there actually are of cases like this. Very difficult because they've already assume the identity. The person is dead. Okay. Right. But it happens a lot more than people let on. Well, it's just it's one of those things. Um I'm sure it happens and I'm sure it's happened, but uh there's there's just no there's no stats on it. There's no way to get stats on it. So it's hard for me to though there is a way to get a stats on this. Okay. That every single year 1 million legal immigrants come into the United States. How many illegal immigrants do you think are here? Uh I think probably five or six times the estimate that they say. Okay. What what do they say the estimate is? Uh Brian have to pull it up officially. 11 million million. 11 million. Yeah. No no no no. Uh, so Mick, at the in the StreamYard, it's in the actual browser. Do you see where it says private chat? It's on primary monitor. It's on your primary monitor. It's selected. Do you see where it says private chat? No. No. Hold on. So, just switch this back to comments. Do you see that comments tab? No. No. No. No. Okay. Yeah, we're on private chat. Look. Uh, four up. It says comments it there. Okay. Um now, uh here I'm going to pull this up. I don't think it pertains to how many illegal immigrants are in the country, but this is from homeland.house.gov. So, this is uh Department of Homeland Security. I believe this is their source. Hold on one sec, guys. I'm multitasking a dozen different things here. Uh so, Mick, I'm going to have you scroll down just a little bit. New documents reveal airports used by Secretary Mayorcas to fly hundreds of thousands of inad inadmissible aliens into US via CHNV mass parole scheme. Scroll down. CHNV mean? Scroll down. Washington DC. Today, the House Committee on Homeland Security revealed documents obtained through subpoena of the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, that identified over 50 airport locations, including our nation's capital, used by DHS to help process into the country more than 400,000 inadmissible aliens through the through the administration's unlawful Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan mass parole program. The program was officially launched in January 2023 and the documents obtained by the committee cover the period from January to August, accounting for roughly 200,000 of these individuals. Uh, according to these documents, as of mid-occtober 2023, there were 1.6 million inadmissible aliens awaiting travel authorizations through this program. Scroll down quite a bit more. Uh, keep going, keep going. So according to these documents, scroll down, scroll down, scroll down, scroll down. The top 15 airport loc, stop, stop, stop. The top 15 airport locations used for the program and the number of inadmissible aliens who flew into a port of entry between January August 2023 were Miami 91,000, Fort Lauderdale 60,000, New York City 14,000, Houston uh 8,000, Orlando 6,000, Los Angeles 3,000, Tampa 3, thou etc etc. Scroll down a bit. The the other airports used for the program. Okay, that's fine. Uh, and I mean that's pretty much it as it relates to the flights. Yeah. And you can point out too that there was a a time period here during uh C19 uh when when COVID was going on, right? Where most of the ballots were mailin, right? and mail the mail and ballot system is like the worst idea ever conceived by man because the proofs there were uh very slight to have those votes counted. So uh having having thousands of unsecured ballot locations, right? Yeah. This was Yeah, they can definitely participate in the political process whether they are supposed to or not. Okay. So that's I mean those are the arguments I guess there. Do you have a position on this at all or I don't think I have anything to contribute that hasn't already been said. Um so I don't feel like it's necessary for me to to jump in on that one. Are there any other topics that you feel more religion is her thing. Religion. Is there anything Okay, we can do that. with the flow though. So, are there any other people people often lose interest on the religion topic? I'm just being honest with you. We can keep it quick too also if that's a concern. Um, I mean sex work is a topic that, you know, I'm passionate about, but I'm not sure if that's a tired topic on this podcast. Why are you passionate about it? Um well, I think there are a lot of different viewpoints from different kinds of sex workers um on several different topics, whether it comes to legalization or um what's the word I'm looking for? kind of like a a control over that industry that we may or may not have depending on what the circumstances are, such as places where it's legal like Nevada or whether we're looking at protection for people who work independently, not necessarily on the street, but like online and things like that. Oh, I see what you're saying. Okay. So, you're making a distinction between um legislating it in multiple multiple ways, right? So, you're talking about are we talking about protecting sex workers or this or that or Yeah, there's there can be a lot of opposing viewpoints. Um, I have the 100% number one way to protect sex workers. Ban them. They don't be sex workers. It's one what? 100% effective. Wouldn't you agree? Not necessarily. No. Um, no. I don't think I could answer that with just a yes or no. Um, because I think there's slightly more nuance to it. Um, I can only use where I work currently as an example. Um, where we are very well protected. Um, is there a chance though a chance for a chance for you to in some way be assaulted or uh something like this through the fact that you're a sex worker? Um, well, there's always that chance is there. But there's a 100% chance that you're not going to be assaulted as a sex worker if you're not one. Right. Well, I think as a woman there's always a chance, right? But it's not going to be based on the fact that you're in an industry where this is much more common than when you're not in the industry. Right. I couldn't give you a percentage, but that could be a fair statement depending. Oh, yeah. It's much more common. Assaults are sex workers, of course. Yeah. Because I can only speak on where I work. Um, you know, the the security is great. We all have business licenses. We receive testing once a week. were background checked by the county. Um whether that be a sheriff's department or a police department, it depends on your Is this one of the ranches? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Gotcha. So, so the thing is is like um my understanding in those places they have like literal guard dogs that they patrol the perimeters with. They have armed security. And I don't know if that's true or not. This is just what I'm told, right? So, I'm sure security there is bar none fantastic. Do you ever go into a room with a John alone? Yeah. Do you do that as part of your daily course? I don't understand. Do when you go into a room with a John alone, right, is that part does that would would you consider that a routine part of your job? Yes. Yeah. So then you're do you usually know these John's? No. No. Okay. So, so then what you're saying is is that yes, this place is really well guarded until you go into a room by yourself with a John, right? And then you engage in sexual activity and your chances there of being abused obviously are significantly higher than if you were not in the room with the stranger having sex with them, right? Yeah. I would say it also depends on what kind of services you're offering as well. That can make a big difference in why consider the odds. But just like being in the room with the John, doing anything sexual is going to increase your chances of being assaulted. Right. That chance is always there. Yeah. So I have a my 100% foolproof way to make sure that you because I care about you never get assaulted again is that you never do sex work. And then I can guarantee that you'll never be in a room with a strange man again unless it's by some valition of your own. Not because you need money where that man will assault you. What about Only Fans? So what about it? So I mean obviously there is a point uh in person sex work you're alone with a random man. That can be scary. Um only fans though, how can that be dangerous? Uh parasocial relationships. So, okay, that So, let's see if we can untangle this, right? I'm positive, right, in my streaming career, I I have at least some people who probably have a parasocial relationship with me. You know what that term means, right? Yeah. Yeah. Uh there's nothing I can do about that. That's going to come with the territory. I take so the only thing I can do is be as responsible as I possibly can do or be by if such a relationship bubbles and I can see it by putting the kibos on it right saying things like I'm not your friend I'm not your buddy right I'm I'm just an entertainer you happen to be a fan right this parasocial kind of relationship not that I haven't had fans that have become friends because they have right but I'm just saying generally speaking I try to put the kibos on that immediately right away from your angle though, right? A par a parasocial relationship is going to be way way more likely because of the nature because the nature of what you're doing. So that puts you at a higher elevated risk in comparison to even other people in similar industries. But I I also I don't use my um my name or anything, my real name. So um and do you think that would stop people? I think it would make it a little bit harder. Sure. Um, but I I mean I've been doing it for a while. I think some people definitely do have a parasocial relationship with me. I was just watching a story this morning. Uh, there was a a guy, I don't remember his name, but he was like a bald dude and he developed a parasocial relationship with an Only Fans girl and he began to spend his family's credit card money. I think I've seen that. Yeah. Yeah. Started spending his family's money on her. He became completely obsessed. He became totally iate. And when they tried to put the kibos on the relationship, he was so invested that he actually murders his entire family in order to continue this relationship. Right now, I'm willing to grant, right, that there are musicians and other people out there who are so ridiculously famous that there's deranged fans who would do something similar with them and they're not in sex work. I'm just stating that the chances of it are way higher in your industry. And wouldn't that be part of my responsibility as well though, like being on the internet to make sure these people don't get connected to me in that way or attached to me in that way? Cuz I I do try Well, I think the nature of what you do is to try to create this kind of relationship literally on purpose. So, and this is all by the nature of the work itself. It's not saying so I I'm gonna try to be charitable here. I think you can. You're You try to divorce yourself. Me the What's your name? I'm sorry. Savannah. Savannah. Savannah. Savannah. That Savannah the person is trying to divorce herself from Savannah the sex worker. These are two different people. When Savannah the sex worker is doing sex work, that's not really who she is. She's this whole other person who likes flowers and unicorns and pretty nails or whatever the it is, right? like whatever that person is is not this person. But this person who does do the sex work is being provocative, trying on purpose to be seductive, trying on purpose in order to make a person feel a certain way, a certain connection so that they open up their wallet and give you money. Okay? Right? And I think that that is part of the nature of that work. Whereas for most other types of work, um on camera, film, things like this, that is not the case. How is this different though? Because this is not designed to seduce. This is not designed to introduce the parasocial aspect in. It's much more straightforward. So like uh assume a Hollywood actor is really straightforward too. I'm providing you entertainment. I get paid, right? I'm not really here to I'm I am trying to elicit emotions in you, but the emotions aren't specifically the idea of I'm seducing you and creating the context that there's something here between us. That's that's the feeling I'm trying to introduce. Like in your sex work, for instance, um do you ever moan really loud? Do you ever pretend that you're really into it when you're not? Do you ever, you know, the answer is likely yes, right? I actually um do a lot of different kinds of services that actually lean far more towards um trying to be careful with my wording. Um kink centered I would say. Sure. Um it's far less of you know the standard stereotypical for me personally. But are you pretending on purpose to enjoy things maybe you don't enjoy? you're pretending to be into those things when you're not really into them because you're trying to elicit a response from the person they're that gives into whatever their fantasy is. Right. Um me personally, no. Because I don't offer any kind of service that I wouldn't enjoy delivering on. Um I do have that luxury. I don't speak for everyone. I only speak for myself. So you've never pretended to be more into it than you're not than you are. I have to. Oh, okay. Well, you would agree though that at least in your industry that women are going to be moaning. They're going to be like screaming at the top of their lungs. They're going to be doing things like this even though they ordinarily Yeah. I'm sure it happens with you too whether you admit it or not. But that aside, yeah. Yeah. Coming Yeah. Coming back to this, the idea here is that you're specifically trying to get those responses, right? whereas I think that other forms of entertainment specifically are not trying to develop the parasocial aspect. I can I totally agree uh about the safetiness of it but um I think taking measures to make sure that in case anything happens you can protect yourself. I think um I mean whether regardless of if I did sex work or not I would want to have that protection. Yeah. So, um I don't feel any less safe doing it, but I uh but I get to be at home. So, yeah. Yeah. But I mean you these are well like these are tiered arguments, right? So, the first tier is the safety of even the prostitute in this case, right? And of the John are paramount. We got the we have the overarching STDs which are in this industry which including over fan only fans have an over representation of STDs cons uh against the general public. Why? Because they do BG GG content, right? And often times they're not as rigorously even tested as the people in the corn industry are when they do that sort of content. So uh then we have to compete with that with the uh amount of STDs that come in. Then we have to deal with the trafficking that comes in with this. And then all I mean the list just is like endless of the societal ills that come with sex work. Whereas banning it, what really what bad happens when we ban this that there's a black market potentially that opens up for it. Well, I think I I think South Korea is a good example of what happens when you do ban porn. It's not really banned there. I know officially it is, but it's not actually. But I think they they have higher rates of uh rape and sexual assault and they also have the law there than than what the United States. Definitely not. Okay. Yeah, definitely not. I mean I do we can I mean I could be wrong. I'm willing to concede if I'm wrong because we're talking about stats off the top of our head, but can you look at the It's hard to things up. Yeah, I see. I see. Okay. I'm willing to concede if I'm wrong on that, but I would find it like kind of stunning if it was the case or if that that was the case and there wasn't at least underlying reasons for it that aren't as obvious as what you're portraying. Right. Okay. So, but yeah, it is true that in South Korea it is banned, but it's not IP banned really, right? So, people can still access it when they want. It's a very westernized nation, right? And and I would even argue that absent feminism and the the various herbivore movements that are going on in these Asian nations, what do they call it now? Not herbivore. The um isn't that the term herbivore? Well, that's for Japan. But they whatever where women are checking out and men are checking out of the Department of Relationship period because they don't want to be with these feminists. That you probably wouldn't see that sort. Yeah. You probably Yeah. Yeah. There you go. that you probably wouldn't see that sort of consumption um you know even the IP ban consumption you probably wouldn't see that. So there's other things that are going on in South Korea which I would contribute to uh other crises which are happening there not not because of not just corn being banned. Yeah. That's actually a very popular position there by the way to keep it banned like people reintroduce trying to get it uh approved again and it just gets smacked down every time. So yeah, I think that there could be uh some regulations when it comes to uh corn in America. Um okay. Well, maybe we can get agreement then. Okay. So maybe we can find some agreement here. Here's here's my perfect compromise plan, right? You have to show ID. Yeah. You have to upload ID in order to get on a corn website. I agree. Have to. I agree. Okay. Period. And uh it needs to there needs to be some sort of verification there for that. Yeah. You agree with that? Yeah, I do agree with that. What do you think will happen to the market though? Well, the the thing is that uh Only Fans already does that. So, nobody can get on to my Only Fans unless they upload their ID that says that they're 18 plus. So, um but as for Pornhub and that I I don't know. I've I've the age the next thing I would implement is that at the very least the age of sex work needs to start at 26. 26. Yeah. So if we began alcohol if we if we raise the age of alcohol to 21. This is arbitrary. But we just think well you're probably not at responsible enough to have a drink or a cigarette until you're 21. We can kind of arbitrarily set it forward from there. Right. I think that this is a huge decision that 18, 19, 20, 21 year olds probably shouldn't make. So, let's make it 26. Okay. Would that work? Um, no. No. Not going to like that part. Well, I I see where you're coming from, but I um I do think when it comes to stuff like Only Fans like that has not been detrimental to my career, my schooling or anything. Uh and I started that when I was um 20 or 21. Yeah, but it's not about you. Well, yeah, but obviously this is it affects you. My example, but it affects me. It affects him. It affects everybody, right? All societal ripples are that way. So, right, the question is is like should I have a say? Yes. And so my say is is like if we can't outright ban it, which I would prefer, right? then we can set in such rigors to it that it greatly reduces the consumption of it. Okay. I I agree with the ID verification. Mhm. But not the age going up. No, I but I I do see where you're coming from though. Um you know, people that get into it the day they turn 18, it's Yeah. Yeah. No problem. Um, but you know, I just people are they are allowed to make their own choices and it is what it is, you know. No, we don't let people make their own choices if they're bad for society. We we regulate all the time. Okay. I just I don't see that. I don't see a 21-year-old making contact. I don't see that. If you knew a product was poisonous, but it just killed a person slowly over time. alcohol, right? Well, if sure, let's even take that. Okay. Right. If if your like 18-year-old son wanted alcohol, would you tell him he should have it? Yeah, he can have a little I mean, yeah, you can have the nonpoisonous dose, right? Well, you can have a beer. Well, well, sure. But this is the my rebuttal for this is that every person that consumes corn, they have the responsibility to consume it in a decent amount. They totally their responsibility to not get corn rot. Yeah. But here's the thing that's funny. It's like I can agree with you and at the same time still be right. So I I'll explain. So I agree with you that the consumer also has responsibility just like the producer, right? But which one's way more easy to regulate? The millions of consumers or the few producers? Right. I mean that's that's true, but it's it's all the same with alcohol though. I know people Mhm. are alcoholics, but it's it's their fault. You know, we're not going to ban alcohol because But what happens? But what do we see with alcohol? Well, what happens? We see national campaigns everywhere. Don't drink and drive. Don't consume this. This is poisonous. This is bad for you. We're not allowed to advertise it on television. You're not allowed to, you know what I mean? You can't advertise it here. You can't put it on YouTube. You can't, you know what I mean? There's all sorts of various things. Um, and all sorts of restrictions and massive national campaigns. You have mothers against drunk driving. The penalties for drunk driving are through the roof. You know what I mean? You get additional penalties you wouldn't even get if you were perhaps stoned or something else in certain states, right? We have huge campaigns against this. Where's that for corn? Nowhere. The the examples that you're bringing up, drinking and driving, people do die from that. Um, people die from this as well. I just gave you an example of a person who had a parasocial relationship. He do off his entire family. But not only that, um these behaviors ultimately aren't just for drinking and driving. The national campaigns against the behavior themselves. Drinking is not great, right? It's not something there. There's open container laws everywhere. Like everything that you see in society is is stigmatizing alcohol except in a small case use specific type of thing. You know what I mean? And that's at the national level. Now, maybe there would be a good point from prostitutes if they were like, "Look, this is stigmatized at the national level and people still want to do it. At least there would be some resistance, but it's like it's just glorified. Where is the state glorifying alcohol? Nowhere. Well, I don't know if I would say that it's glorified. I think it's heavily censored." Like, I mean, it's totally glorified. You can't just You can't have people making corn on the side of the road. Like, you that's not allowed. That's not legal. Like I there are there are things put in place. Yeah. There's there's there's restrictions which existed pre the corn industry for public decency. That's true. But when you're talking about what are we doing on a societal level to push back against it. Societies use stigmatization and things like this in order to push out behavior that we don't like. We do this at a national level all the time. So if you want to see more LGBTQ people, what do you do? You have LGBTQ awareness month and you have all sorts of like pro propaganda or that again negative connotation on the word propaganda but everybody knows what the word means, right? You would have tons of propaganda towards LGBTQ. You'd have tons of propaganda towards those things. Reinforcing that they're good. They're good. This is good. We want more of this. Good, good, good, good. You see it all over the news. It's good. It's good. That helps propagate that into the ethos is this is behavior which we consider to be acceptable and decent and we want to see more of it. The opposition to that would be if you had like pro- family and pro- you know nuclear family and and pro-atriarchy propaganda or stuff like this, right? You'd see a lot more of that. So, uh we adjust our conditionals based on uh what we see as as stigmatization or not. When I when I look at alcohol, it seems like everything moves towards stigmatization. everything moves towards don't be a drunk, don't be doing this. This is not good. Right. I have to read a couple chats. So, we have uh guys, if you want read is 100, TTS is 200. Uh Spawny, we do these at intervals. Um but I appreciate your message. Yours is coming up first. Okay, Spawny. All right. CBP1 app was allowing illegals to bypass showing up at the border and flown in directly into the country. The dumb was worried by dumb. Oh, Biden was worried about the border optics. That is how Haitians overran Ohio and ate cats and dogs. All right. Thank you for that, Spawny. Appreciate it. We have a super chat here from uh Kenneth Gudro. Can I have you read the super chat for me? Me? Yeah. Yeah. From the Crucible here. Brian, can I get a shout out to my son Maverick? Andrew loved seeing you on Piers Morgan. Sorry, off topic here. Respect. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Uh, thank you, Kenneth, for the super chat. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Uh, well, I shout out to uh Kenneth, his son. Uh, let's see. I'll do it into this camera. Yo, Maverick, you're a legend. Thank you, man. Uh, and your dad's a legend, too. Kenneth, you're also legend. Glad you guys uh enjoyed the show. Thank you. Uh, could you read this one from Nathan? Hey, Brian. This is my first time super chatting. Thank you, Nathan. Big fan of the show and of you, Andrew, Rachel, and Jake the Rattlesnake. Keep doing what you're doing. Everybody there is good except for Jake. He's scum. Oh, wow. And uh he's the And he's Australian. Well, he's the fake king of Australia. Younger. He usurped the title from his brother who was much more based than he is in everybody. Okay, there you go. Well, uh, Kenneth and Nathan, thank you guys for these super chats. And let me see if there's No. Okay, we're good on that. You know what, chat? Um, me and Andrew were [Music] uh do you guys want somebody to crash the stream? So, uh, we were going to try to do this Thursday, but unfortunately we we were going to just have to postpone it. But, uh, since we have a bit of time tonight, do you guys remember? Well, of course you remember uh P Priscilla, the girl who attacked Andrew. We were going to do I I'll just spoil it. So on third, what we were going to do was going to be a tag team 2v2. Me and Andrew, this was going to be a super DJ panel. Uh me and Andrew and Desiree. Me and Andrew, Desiree, and Priscilla. That would have been bonkers. Yeah. Uh, I don't know what what you even call that. A royal rumble or something. Call that divine punishment. Something like that. Um, but uh Desire is in LA, but Priscilla's in Santa Barbara. So, chat, do you want to This is a redemption episode for Priscilla. You want her to come and crash and then we'll have her join the panel and uh what do you think, chat? But I think uh in order to do that, Andrew, do we need a champagne pop or what do you think? I think we should get one. At least one. at least one champagne pop. The chat is mixed. So, I'm reading the chat now. They're saying, "Hell no." Don't listen to him at all. Yes. Yes. No. Yes. No. It's not It's not a democracy. No. Yes. Yes. No. It's not a democracy. Um Well, guys, so it wouldn't be Desiree tonight, uh but it would be Priscilla. So, and then there's also the girl with uh the the with the dyslexia, the girl who was sitting right there on last episode. We She's also still in town, so maybe we could have her Lord have her. What do you think, chat? Should should we have Priscilla? And then what was her name? The What was the girl? Jen. Should we have her just IQ of like 140? The 140 IQ. Maybe we can have her. Uh, but we're going to need a champagne pop. Doesn't have to be crystalall, just regular champagne pop. I think we're going to need a champagne pop for that one. So, if you want for if you want to see a confrontation, us confront Priscilla on her assault of Andrew of her. You know, that's pretty bad. Oh, pretty bad. Oh, pretty awful. for Champagne Pop. We will bring Priscilla here right now and spice up the tonight's show a little bit. Uh so yeah. Um Spyro Spiro, can I have you read this one for me? Uh Sav, speaking of immigration, there's one country that will never ever ever be able to send illegal immigrants Australia because it's not real. Correct. Rattlesnake. Rattlesnake in shambles. Shambles. All right. Thank you, Spyro. Lying round earthers. Uh, can you read this one, too? He sent in another one. Uh, speaking of immigration, I'm surprised Brixen is against it. Think of all the illegals that could make burritos for him under the table. So, I'm actually, listen, Andrew is not going to like me for that. Or maybe I don't know. I'll know his position on this. I am in favor of illegal immigration as follows. women between the ages of 18 and 29 who are uh who are athletes, gymnasts, pull vters, swimmers, nuts. I won't accept softball players from other countries, but I will accept What about yoga enthusiasts? I will accept yoga enthusiasts, but uh you know track and field is acceptable. Not the long distance chips. most the most degenerate immigration policy I've ever heard. What are you talking about? They're not sex workers, Andrew. They're they're athletes. Uhhuh. Just Just bring them all in. Female illegal immigrant athletes. I'll accept from all uh Eastern Europe would be good. Some Eastern European gymnasts. Very fit. Um I will accept from you know what we we're going to prioritize uh Eastern European. We're going to Asian countries, Western. We can even Hey, Western European. Why not? I know what you're thinking. I can see it in your eyes. You're thinking that's racist. No, it's not. He He specifically ruled out Western Europe. Specifically ruled it out. That's not what I was thinking. I'm okay with Western Europe, but Eastern Europe first. Okay. And you're also okay with like Mexican chicks? Latin America acceptable. Okay. But the I prefer, you know, like let's start just just to make things a bit more fair, the like the South American first. Well, you want Eastern European first, right? Because the South American South Americans are already coming in droves if Yeah. So, so we want to make it fair, right? I'm saying like if if Mexico is Central America, right? Is it that's or is it part of North America? Is wait is Mexico Central America or North America? What isn't it? Central America. I can't tell if nobody's answering. No, it's definitely North Mexico's North America. Wait, hold on. Let me Google. It's North America. No, I know where Mexico is. I just don't know if it's categorized as Central America. Is Is Mexico still going to be a part of one of the two continents? Right. It is cons. It is North America. Yeah, it's North America. It's not I know it's not South America, but I was wondering if it was the distinction if it was Central America because Central America you got like Costa Rica, Nicaragua, uh Panama, Guatemala. What's the other one? Or uh I'm I'm terrible with geography, man. I wouldn't I would Honduras. El Salvador. That's like s Okay. Okay. That's gonna get clipped. So, um, yeah, but I'm thinking like Argentina. I'm thinking like Argentina. Let's bring some gymnasts pvault like Argentinian gymnasts and then we move our way up. We get to like Costa Rica. We can bring then we can get to Mexico with their ath female, sorry, female only athletes and gymnasts and so forth. Makes sense. Uh, so there's that. Okay, let's see if there's uh Okay, so guys, uh really quick, read 100, TTS 200. If you want Priscilla, if you want her to come, we're gonna we're gonna have a have a uh a sit down with her. We're going to have a combo. Uh sh We got sh We need a champagne pop for that. Like the video. Like the video, guys. twitch.tv whatever. Discord.gg whatever. Uh and then uh let's see here. You don't think Brian's too mean to the girls on the show? They love the show. They're big fans. I think I it does depend on uh if they're mean to him. That's true. Which I guess I've only seen clips of like them yelling at each other, so I was like, "Ah, he sucks, you know?" Well, I've noticed this I've noticed this really funny thing, right? So, um I've been working in industrial circles my whole adult life, right? So, when I go in to do a job, that's just what I'm used to. So Brian, you'll see Brian, he kind of very sharp with his language. Like, can you be quiet right now because we're doing X, right? Things like this for me, right? I just think of it as this guy is the foreman. He's doing what he's supposed to be doing. You know what I mean? Right. And I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I never took But I've noticed that women have a really hard time with that. Well, I know you're going to hate it, but it's it's tone policing. It really is. Totally. It's the way it's the way you say it. If you say it with like a little bit of oomph. Do you think that that could be like possibly what the pay gap is? The gender pay gap is because women can't handle tone. Like they just can't handle it. And so employers employers are like, you know, I think we're just going to hire men for this and pay them more and incentivize them because then I can talk to them how I need to talk to them without them like crying and whining about tone. Totally. That's what I think. Okay. I'm memeing. I don't really think that, but I just think it's funny. I just think it's funny. Yeah. Uh, you got anything for us? You got Cuz you're like DM'd us. I want to be her debate partner. Waiting for a little I felt like it would be a little bit unfair for her to be on here by herself. Yes, that's true. Well, originally it was just going to be a one v one, so I doubled it up because yell at him. I offered to and you never responded. Wait, what? I said we could yell at each other if you want, but I'm not just going to do that for no reason. Wait, I'm not sure what you're talking about. When I asked for the address and I was like, "Also, we can yell at each other if you want. Like we can have beef for entertainment purposes. We don't stage stuff. All the beef is natural. Okay. But originally you were like, "Hey, I want to be her debate partner. What do you want to debate?" She's good with religion. She knows a lot about Yeah. I'm not really sure how the structure works given I could only watch so many episodes at a time before getting here. So, I'm just kind of waiting to be prompted. Yeah. In this format, it's open. It's an open debate because like during a panel it's not because there's so many people and you're getting to, you know, and and it's not even designed necessarily to to be a debate. There's going to be some debate that happens, but it's not always designed for debate at all. It's just designed for people. Most of the clips I've seen, it was with the panel. So, I think I got a little confused and I don't want to interrupt anyone either. Um, like letting your conversation Yeah, that was fine. I didn't feel the need to butt in on that because I I felt a lot of good things were being said. So yeah. Is religion something we can discuss or is that boring for you guys? We don't have I'm not a religious debater. Andrew is probably a bit more wellversed in that. What are your criticisms of religion? You said it was delusional. Um yeah, I would definitely say so. I think it is wildly illogical to me from my perspective. Um I don't understand personally why um a god that seems to glorify suffering to earn peace and eternal life. Um you know why what's deserving of worship? What's but this is a problem is like you use religious terms in order to uh criticize religion. Like when you say say words like suffering, how do you account for suffering? Suffering just means that you don't like. That's it. That's all suffering means. I can narrow it down a little bit. I mean, if I You're going to narrow You will, but you're just going to narrow it down to subjective experiences I don't like or don't prefer. I think I think And if you if you if that's not what it narrows down to, I'm going to be stunned. But I'm going to let you narrow it down. So, what is suffering? I would say the the suffering I was more referring to would be suffering that I believe is more unjust. Not just because someone made a bad decision or messed up. I'm more referring to um children and cancer and horrific things like that. Um, the most common thing that I've ever been told is everything happens for a reason and if this terrible thing happens to this young child, leukemia, things like that, um, that it was all God's will. And I I personally don't understand that whatsoever because what has such a young child done to deserve any kind of That's really strange that you you're in uh you you were raised Catholic. Yes. And they told you it's in God's will. Yes. That people get cancer. It's all part of God's plan. Oh, I see. Okay. Well, the problem is again, so all of the criticisms that you would come up with for religion, right? You have to account for all of them. So when you say words like just, it's loaded. Like what is justice? Well, I can give you two forms of justice. There's a Christian form of justice you're probably more used to. like empathy. Oh, you came in and you stole a bunch of from my house. Is it then just for me to go and steal a bunch of from your house? No. No. That's really weird though because I can give you a completely alternative view of justice that seems like it's totally within the confines of reason. If you steal from my house for me to be able to steal from yours, that seems completely within the line of reason. Seems totally logical to me. There's nothing illogical about it. There's no violations of the laws of logic, right? It's well within reason. What's the problem? The problem is is you just don't prefer that kind of justice, right? Sure. I'm also not 100% clear on some of the differences between Catholic and Christian teachings. You know, I can say Catholics are Christians. I would say I've been told by a few people that there's like some different teachings or how they're interpreted personally. So totally people will not consider them to be Christians. Yes, that's true. Non-denom. So I would just largely chop it up to three. There'd be I chop it up this way. Okay. Most Orthodox would just say everything that's not orthodox is Protestant. But I just chop it up to there is Protestantism. These are the all of the branches of the of Christianity which came from Martin Luther after the schism. And then there's Catholicism which came from Orthodoxy after the schism. Then there's Orthodoxy, the original church of Christ. So that's how I would view it. Right. So how do you uh I mean I've I've read most of the Old Testament. I haven't finished it. Um some of the new one, but when it comes to science and religion, I know that's always like such a an annoying topic, but how do you justify the Bible through that? Well, science doesn't make science can't make claims about the metaphysical. Like, science science can't tell you if there there are not ghosts. No, it can only it can only test whether or not there are or not ghosts here. Right. But but it's not going to make ought claims, right? It's not going to make any It just doesn't test for that. So, right. If if I wanted so so if you're doing a scientific experiment, it's got to be falsifiable, right? That's what makes it so the thing is is um we're going to start with an observation. In this case, you're going to observe you think there's a ghost. Let's say you think there's one, right? So then your hypothesis is like, I don't know, uh there's an ethereal realm and this person hasn't passed on yet, right? Something like this. And then you're going to conduct an experiment. Let's say you go and you get equipment and you come up with electronic voice phenomenon, right? And you're trying to catch the spirit's voice on that or some right? So, you can even say like ghost hunting could be a rigorous scientific endeavor. It doesn't sound like one, though, does it? You know what I mean? It's it's it's not really designed to to answer those kinds of questions. That's not what it's there to do. I just mean in terms of like it says the Earth was created 6,500 years ago or something. M um well that's young earth creationism but the thing is part of the thing is is like uh there are people who fight over young earth or old old earth creation. I've always considered it to be a silly fight to have because it really has nothing to do with the with the point. So uh the Bible warns us not to uh adhere to endless genealogies so that we don't get bogged down in nonsensical questions like that. Right? It's just not that important from the Christian purview whether the earth is 6,000 years old or not. Well, maybe not. But the point is that it is older than 6,000 years. So there there is really no argument when it comes to that, which is just one example of something in the Bible that I mean when they wrote it, they had no understanding of like geoysical sciences. So they well they you know they understood a lot more than people think. Like I hear people say they didn't really understand things very well, but and one of the things I hear all the time is like, "Well, they didn't understand where babies came from." It's like, "But the whole Old Testament is filled with his seed will go into her." You know what I mean? And I'm like, "I think they kind of got where babies came from." But what about like when they said that plant life was made before the sun? That was before we had an understanding of Genesis of photosynthesis. Yeah. I don't I don't know what the exact verbiage is in Genesis for which which in the creation story which thing came first was plant life and then sun. Okay. Sure. I mean I don't know if that's the case. I'd have to pull up Genesis in order for me to contextualize it. But I'm just saying like again these seem like the least important questions. Like let's even say that the accounting of that was was incorrect or just an allegory or something like that. I don't believe it was. I think it's both actually true and it's allegorically true and it is also um trying to convey like various lessons and this kind of thing. Right. Right. Um but let's just say for the sake of argument that that was not actually the case. How does that really contradict with Christian ethics ultimately? I don't think it contradicts the ethics, but I think that it makes uh the Bible like illogical like it makes it not as I I just I wouldn't trust it for Mhm. anything. I mean, mor morality wise, I think um that it had some good ideas, maybe the new one. Yeah, but when people are making moral claims about religion, they're not referencing whether or not you think it's it's logical what what happened in Genesis or the parting of the sea or things like that. They're not that's not really what it's testing for when it comes to Christian ethics and Christians are making moral claims, right? So, what is it testing for? Well, Christians are are taking the virtues and the teachings of Jesus Christ and what they're doing is they're uh they're taking these these concepts and combining them into an ethical system called Christian ethics. Okay? They're making ought prescriptions on that, right? So, even my argument would just always be because I'm not a Christian apologist. There's people way better at that than me for the accounting stories and things like that. But my argument is always just like even if morality is subjective, Christian ethics clearly has a ton of value. Even to consequentialists, it seems to have a ton of value. So even if it is the case that Christians were delusional, like you said, it seems like you would want them to be because they're they're super charitable. Super charitable. And they I don't think they're bad. Yeah. Exactly. And they keep society they keep society rolling, right? So even if it was the case that you thought they were living in a delusion, like who cares? From your view, it's like they should probably live in that delusion. It's probably better that they live in that delusion. See, I think that uh I think that religion can be really good for people, give them a sense of purpose. Um, but I think that something I've said before is that I think it's um it's like a betrayal of intellect to not let yourself question the how or the why of the creation of the universe. Yeah. But I mean, in the skeptic tradition, you should be questioning skepticism, too. And the fact that you can't give an accounting for any of the things that you actually care about, like justice. Justice is your preference, right? Uh the idea of justice is your preference. The idea of fairness is your preference. The idea of basically everything is your preference. Shouldn't you be skeptical of that too? I don't think you answered my question. What's the question? Um, what was my question? I What did I say? I don't know. Oh, I I didn't I didn't I'm not trying to deflect from any questions. No, no, no. I lost it. Yeah. So, but I'm just saying that I think I think ultimately even from the viewpoint of the secularist or the subjective atheist or whatever the secular humanist that the most amount of value that people get is from Christianity anyway because they can give you objective unchanging accountings of things and you basically necessarily say things need to change. Well, I think that it's just important. Sorry. Go ahead. Um, here before uh here Nick Mick, can you pull up the tweets? We're going to switch topics. What happened? Yeah, religion is not a thing that Yeah, we get bogged down on too much. Oh, okay. Pull up the tweets, Mick. It should already be on it. Are you on the first tweet? What? Here, I'll switch it. But do you have it up on that monitor? Okay. Hit F11, please. Oh, did you control tab over? Uh oh. Huh? Mick, hit control shift tab. What the is that? Hold on. actual Okay, I hit control. F11, please. Okay. Yes. My favorite place to see a man is on the floor in front of me. Great question, Andrew. So this is she actually responds uh to one of your tweets. Andrew, should men be the ones sitting on the floor? Anna, you did? Oh. Uh and can Nick, can you click on what? Do you know what? Before we click on it, do you know what that tweet leads to? No. From Anna's, you sent this March 14th, like four days ago. Mhm. Is it to? No, that's a post that she had about um a woman or being on a train there. The woman was on a train. Yeah. So, yeah, I think bad on that. Yeah, I think it should be fine. Okay. Can you click it, Mick? Uh just so with the mouse click click on the tweet from Andrew. Yeah. Yeah. Up. Yeah. Click that. Yeah. No, I Oh, I'm on a train and men are sitting in seats while women stand or sit on the floor. The declining birth rate is an mystery. Was that originally your tweet? No. No, that's a different Anna. Okay. Okay. Let's um do uh control tab over. Yes. I thought that that was a really stupid tweet. Grown men who pursued What's talking about? I don't know. I mean, is this just I was just Is this related to age gap? Like men who date like 19year-olds because they're technically teenagers. Are you talking like about under like minors? Yeah, I would I would assume. I don't remember exactly what post this was on, but I'm talking about like minors whenever I Next. We're going to get into Next. Uh, yes, my dad knows I do Only Fans. The Intels are going to hate this, but the loves me supports. Okay. Um, next. These were just some of the tweets from last time. Who we talking about today? Men next telling sex workers that nobody will love them because their job is so cruel. It's a job. I don't think that's cruel. I think like I don't think that's a cruelty. I think that that's a descriptive reality. I don't think it is. I think it is. Well, it's not nobody. I wouldn't put anything in a monolith. I would say less people. Okay, that's fair. That's a lot a significantly uh a significant amount of people less. So like I think that it'll limit the amount of romantic partners in the future that would be available to you. I think it would limit the types of family dynamics that you would normally be able to have with people that you wouldn't be able to have. It creates stresses on parents and it creates stresses on siblings and it creates stresses on all sorts of people. I agree. But to say they're unlovable, I don't agree with that. To say they're what? They're unlovable. I do not agree with that. Well, no. I mean, there's going to be people who love like your parents are probably going to love you. Even if they disagree, even if they disowned you, they probably would still love you. I'm just saying I don't think it's cruel. Okay. I think it's descriptive to say like maybe not all that's maybe fair, but it's descriptive to say that way less people are going to uh I think it's a cruel thing to say just because uh sex workers are aware of that. I mean, I've been very open about the fact that it is harder to date with an only fans. Um, but I think it's unnecessary to point those things out. It just seems like berating for no reason. No. Well, there's good reason for it. The re the reason is the promotion of stigma. So again, society only has so many ways that it can push behavior or not push behavior. And I think that everybody's essentially always trying to push their worldview all the time. For the most part, I think they are. I just think that the religious are as justified as anybody else in doing that. Okay? And when it comes to stigmatization, I think that stigmatizing things that we don't like is perfectly acceptable and we do it constantly. Here's a good example of that. Smoking. Now, I'm a smoker and that's heavily stigmatized, right? You're not allowed to smoke in restaurants anymore. You can't smoke on planes. Now, you never could when when I became a smoker, but you can smoke in restaurants and bars and you can smoke basically wherever the hell you want. Now you can basically smoke nowhere. Mhm. You know, you can smoke a couple of places away from everybody. That's it. The whole behavior is stigmatized, right? And it's based on your effect of other people and their perception of it. It's the same thing with sex work. It's based on the effect and people's perception. Okay. So, I think it's totally fair for people to do that. I think it's open game, right? Stigmatization. Well, I think they can do that, but I do think it's cruel. So, um I mean I guess on on that uh I mean you do of you're not doing like traditional adult content. You're not escorting. You're not a cortisan. You are um do you uh how long have you been working as a cortisan? [Music] Um mid 2022 or three. I can't remember off the top of my head right now. You've been at it for a little bit. And how old are you again? I'm 27. 27. Were you doing any kind of sex work before 2023? Um, online stuff like there's online cam sites, things like that. Did you do adult uh content? I've never done corn before recently like that. There's like live cams that was more of a thing a couple years ago. Personal cam, solo cam stuff. Yeah. Okay. Like chatterbait or whatever. Yeah, like that. Um, and so when did you start doing that? I can't recall off the top of my head. Um, did you do any stripping? Have you stripped? Okay. So, you started Don't they strip inside those things? Inside those They can, but not everybody does. But you weren't in the strip club. Okay. So, you've been doing uh I uh uh I don't really know what escorting. Well, it's not an escort. Have you ever done like Have you done street walking? No. Like where you're on the street corner? You haven't done that or anything, but you do work at a ranch. Um, how many uh and you said you started in 2023, I believe. So, do you recall which month? Uh, summer. Uh, so like two I couldn't tell you the exact month. Two to three. You've been doing it for two years about Yeah, I'd say that's a big bet. Sure. Okay. And how many uh how often do you work? Um, it can wildly depend. I would say usually um once a month or every other month. You only work once a month. Well, you only work once a month for for two weeks at a time. Oh, I misunderstood your question. You stay on site? Yes. Yeah. Okay. When I typically I'm thinking like in terms of days. Um Yeah. You got to change your mindset slightly because this is this is the legitimate brothel, right? Yeah. So, yeah. But I Okay. So, you work two weeks on, two weeks off, or pretty much. Yeah, Ideally. It depends on the time of year. Okay. Um, and that's been your pretty consistent schedule for the past two years, I would say. So, yes. Okay. How many people do you see per day? That can wildly depend. Also, it can be zero. It can be one, two, three. It's not a crazy number. What's the most you've ever seen per day? Oh, I don't know. Um, for wildly different things, maybe three or four people, but that's not all the same services. And do you ever do any group stuff? Like a couple comes in, they want to sleep with you. Uh a group have do they allow like groups of like they want to do a gang? Um well, something like that I think you would probably have to talk to the manager about. I've never had that request before. So I have done couples. Yeah. Okay. Have you done a thrpple? Like three people come in and you sleep with all of them? No, I've never had that happen to me personally. Okay. Um, and so some days you don't work at all and I'm assuming you get paid per uh encounter. We're independent contractors, so we can set our own price for what it is the person or people are looking for and that price is what you specifically. Is it like a barber shop where you basically just rent out a room there? You pay them a fee to rent out the room and then you get your own clients or do they take a cut? How does it work? Um there's room and board um there but there's also like specialty rooms that have like a hot tub in it or something um that you can also utilize um for bookings that would require such a thing. So you have your own room, but there's also rooms you can use that are on site if that makes sense. But do you uh do they procure the clients or do you or is it both? Um it's both. Okay. And they get a cut of the total price. Um there there's a percentage that's a cut, but it goes towards to you know keeping the lights on. It's a giant building and the water bill it's like paying utilities and rent basically. Okay. And what is the like what what do you charge? Is it like 30 minutes or how how does it work? I can't give like an exact number. Um it's just a legality that I have to follow working in a place like this. But um it can totally depend. There are people who come in and they say, "I only need 15 minutes." And that's totally fine. And there are some people who say, "I want to spend three hours." Do you have discretion negotiation? Wait, I'm sorry. What? Do you have discretion with negotiation or is there a set minimum that the house requires? It's completely up to me. Um, there is like a small standard when it comes to certain things. like if you want to use one of the big specialty rooms with the hot tub, they prefer it to be over a certain dollar amount simply because you're utilizing that and then blocking it off for anybody else. So, um, when it comes to the tweet, I get I'm just asking some questions here. Um, are you currently dating anybody? I am. You're in a relationship with a man, a woman, a man. A man. Okay. Is he also a sex worker? Um he appears in some of my online stuff but he does not work um as a corn star or anything. You have an Only Fans? I do. Yeah. Has he ever worked with another girl on Her Only Fans or is this the first time he's been involved in sex work? Um I believe this is the first time. Okay. Is he uh is he a what's it called? A gigalo or what is it the male jigalow? I'm not familiar with that term. Is he a male prostitute? No. Like does he work at at the ranch I work at? There is one. There is a male. um separate. I've But aren't they usually gay? I know. I've never had the opportunity. Wait, so uh he uh so you're in a How long have you been dating him? About a almost a year, I think. A year. So yeah. Uh you had been doing uh the cordisen brothel stuff for a year when you met him basically. Okay. Uh did you how did you meet him? Um at a bar. I think it was like a a bar and grill. Bar and did you guys like hook up that night or No, we didn't. Okay. Yeah, we had a nice conversation. Yeah. And he like got your number and you guys set up a date for another day. Yeah. Um did you disclose to him that night that you were a prostitute? I did. You told him? Yeah. I'm actually I've been very lucky to never struggle with dating throughout any of my sex work endeavors. So, you see significantly older? No. No. Same age. only like he's roughly 30. Wait, you've never struggled with dating at all? No. And being a sex worker, opening line is BTW, I'm a prostitute. Back when back when I had There's no There's Oh, when you had dating apps. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. No, you're fine. You're totally fine. Um, so you were on a dating app and would you write it in your dating app like BTW? Like carefully? Yes. I don't remember exactly how I worded it because I believe it was hinged. So, I had to be kind of careful cuz they would try to ban me for soliciting even though that's not what I was doing. I could see I could see how you Yeah. But you would tell you would tell I would literally put it on my profile in abbreviated terms and say I'm super upfront about it because okay, we I don't have to waste anybody else's time. If that's a deal breaker for them, that's completely fine. And I don't judge people for that being a deal breakaker at all. That's why I'm super upfront about it. Question for you. Um, how many girls work at the brothel that you're at? It depends. I would say it's usually between maybe like five to eight on a given day. On an average, I would say, but like maybe there's dozens in total throughout the year. Is that fair to say? Yes, perhaps even more. There's like a rotating schedule, I would call it. Yeah. And I mean, uh, of the girls that work there, have are they married? Are they in relationships? Have you heard from them? Um, I don't go out of my way to to ask everybody that I meet. We're all about minding our own business and not crossing professional and personal boundaries. Um, I am aware of several that are in happy relationships. I can't tell you what gender those relationships are, but yeah, not at all uncommon. Okay. because it it would seem to me that the majority of men don't want to have romantic or sexual relationships with a active prostitute. Um but uh so your boyfriend like do you work is it like five days a week? How how does it work? Um, well, the the place I work at, Bella's Ranch is open 247, so I can take a day off or a night off whenever I please. I kind of make my own schedule. And But you said it was like two weeks on, two weeks off. Yeah. I'll travel up there to where it is and I will stay there for two weeks at a time. Sure. Um, and work whichever days I feel like while I'm up there and then I leave and go back home. Okay. And so go back. Do you live with your boyfriend? Yes. Okay. Okay. And so you go back home after a day of working back home to where you and your boyfriend live. Yeah. After the the two weeks that I've been up there, I go back home and we live together. Oh, wait. So you stay there. I'm saying like he doesn't live in that region. So you'll be apart from him for two weeks. Yes. You'll stay at the location at the brothel. Yes. Is the relationship open? Open. What do you like completely open? Yeah. Like you guys can just sleep with whoever you want. he can sleep with whoever he wants. I wouldn't really know what to call it. Um, we're both very open people. We're very comfortable, very confident people. Communication, trust, and honesty is key in a lot of relationships, but especially in one. Is he allowed to b another check is what I'm asking. Sure. Okay. Okay. So, it's an open Yeah, that makes more sense with communication. Of course, it's not like you can just be like, I'm going to the store, but it it is overtly open relationship. So he'll it's ethical non- monogamy. So he'll tell you like has he told you btw babe I'm gonna go Becky? No. I thought you said you I mean it just hasn't come up yet. It's completely off the table. But so I understand that he can sleep with other women. Has he slept with other women? No. But you said there's open. So it's o do you sleep with other men in a nonwork capacity? I don't. No. Do you uh but that's by my choice? Do you sleep with him? Yeah. Okay. And you guys have a sex life, I imagine. Yeah. Okay. And he's okay. Like does he does he need like a 24 to 48 hour window after you a guy? Like maybe we can pause on the kissing. Maybe we can wait a little bit for sex or It takes me like two days to get home. So we've never really had a conversation like that before. But he'll kiss Does he kiss you when you walk in the door? Yeah. Okay. I do brush my teeth. Oh, yeah. We get tested every single week. But do you like for example, let's say you like is there a specific day of the week like Wednesday or it varies? Um, I think it just changed recently, but it's one of the earlier weekdays routinely every single like for example, um, every Monday morning at 9:00 a.m. and that's I can't give out the exact schedule of when we actually do that, but every Monday morning, oops, at 9:00 a.m. a doctor comes and we do all of our testing. There's blood testing and there's swabs. Sure. So, and you might work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Yeah. subsequent to the test, right? You'll have sex subsequent to the test and then you'll go home and then have sex with your boyfriend. I overlap the testing. I will usually leave on you, you know, before I leave, I'll just do the testing again because it's just convenient. Let's just to be clear, every week you work, you ha you'll have sex, then you'll take a te, the STD test, and that'll be the last thing you do, then you leave to go home. Yeah, I I make sure to include one in before I go, which of course though, even if you did do that, STD uh STDs can take days, weeks, or even months uh to show up. So, even if you did the STD test, uh that was you did one that was the last thing you did and then you waited for the results. Um that's kind of an interesting component. But so he's okay, your boyfriend's okay with you having sex with other men for money while in a rel and he doesn't other women. He's more than welcome to. He's just busy. He's busy. But uh Okay. Um wait, can I ask do you guys have to wear I don't know. Protection. Oh, at the brothel, protection is required for absolutely everything. There is no kind of any kind of oral. Yeah. Okay. Required. I This is uh ear muffs, Andrew. You know, I'd rather if I had to wear a condom during a BJ, I'd rather just not get the BJ. I've heard that. Yeah. It's kind of like with hand jobs, I'd rather just not even have a hand job. Yeah. So, it's like, you know what I mean, Andrew? Do you want a BJ with a condom on? It's like, look, hey, you know, you got for the brothel of course. Legally required. But what is this debate, Brian? What is this debate? I don't even Dude, I don't even Never mind. Hold on. Okay. So, anyways, um well, we have uh Oh, uh Mick, can you uh go ahead and head down? Okay. Uh I'm going to read some super chats. We have Kenneth Gudra. Gajel Gudra Gudro. Thank you, Kenneth.

Wait, but here, let's do a bit of adjustment with the microphones here. So, what I meant by like sit there. So, can I Sav, can I have you scoot that way just a teeny bit? Okay. Let me see if I still have you in frame there. That should be good. Okay. Uh, okay. And then can you scoot that chair that way? Scoot that mic that way. Scoot that mic that way. Okay. And then can you like get into the side, please? I'm trying to I'll try to get everybody in frame here. I'm trying my best to get people in frame. Oh. Uh, yeah. Priscilla. Oh, can you not have Here, you got to take that uh thing off if you can. And just like you can leave it anywhere. It's fine. That's going to be Yeah. I keep getting the urge to like bite the microphone. Do you get that or no? Go ahead. Or well, don't bite it. But you can you don't get that. Go ahead. Show us. But don't bite it. Well, that's what I Well, if you're telling me to bite it, but not bite it. How does that make sense? Can't never mind. Can't do both. Never mind. Okay. All right, Priscilla. Uh, please why don't you join us here at the table? Uh, why are you going that way? Just I don't know why that, you know, the first open seat would be good. Hello. Nice to see you. Good to see you again. Uh, okay. Welcome back, uh, Priscilla. So, uh, do you want to introduce yourself to the people? I am Priscilla. Sweet. That's dope. Okay. Welcome. All right. So, uh, Priscilla, you wanted to come back for a redemption episode. Uh, what I guess where do we start? Do, uh, do you want to say sorry to Andrew, maybe? No, but I do want to say I am not I do want to admit that I am ignorant of the YouTube rules and all of that and so I do feel bad about kind of pooping on the the show and so I do apologize to you Brian. Oh for that. Wow. because that I'm very ignorant about the YouTube stuff. I'm learning slowly. So yeah, there's just certain words like the platforms don't allow like oral like demonetize the video. So we try to avoid saying certain words uh slurs. uh there's certain topics that uh we go over before the show like hey don't bring this up. So yeah um but you did kind of you know get in Andrew's face a little bit. Do you want to apologize for for that? No I had it coming apparently. Did he have did Did this monster here? Did he have it coming? That was the first time I've ever met you. And it was love at first sight. So why did you try to dress me down? Like [Music] he's a married man. I'm sorry. Like that all happened because you came back. I didn't say a word to you and then he came back and started trying to dress me down. That's when I made fun of you. I thought it was interesting that I presented an a thought about an argument that you made in the past and then instead of having a proper rebuttal, you just attacked my character. Oh, wait. So, well, first of all, I didn't attack your character. I made fun of your voice. But the thing is is that that's part of my character. You came back. You No, that's not what happened. When you came back, who the hell are you to do XYZ? That's not an argument. I didn't say who the hell are you to do XYZ? You did. You said that's her culture. Who are you to question her cult? So these You weren't making an argument. You said you don't know about her culture. You were trying to take I think that's laughable. You were trying to take a shot at me on your way out the door and so I took a shot at you back. Otherwise, I wouldn't have engaged at all. And by the way, up until that point, that was not about you. That was Yeah, that was about No, you were you were getting into it. You're like, "And you, Andrew, blah blah blah blah blah." And then I made fun of you a little bit, but before that, it was totally respectful to you as long as you were respectful to me. Is that not true? Did I say something before that that was disrespectful? I was on my way out and it's I want to say it's like the equivalent of of punching someone while they're turned around. You came back to yell at me. I did not come back to yell at you. Yes, you did. You were leaving and then you came, you said, "Brian, you're a small small man." Then as you were leaving, you came to take a shot at me. So then I made fun of you a little bit. Yeah, me directly. Not any of my ideas, not my philosophy. So it was warranted for you to personally attack Brian? No, that was rude. But Brian, but that is between Brian and Oh, I see. So, the thing is is like you didn't you weren't turning around to take shots at me. You were just turning around to because you wanted to make an argument on your way out the door. That's very strange. I guess I felt unheard and I wanted to feel heard and I wanted to get my say and I felt like I my voice was being sort of how how was I I didn't have anything to do with that. I was just sitting here. Yeah, I was literally just sitting here. I didn't do anything to you. Then I made fun of you slightly because you decided weird. You decided to you decided to dress me down. Yeah, I don't think it was that bad. No, I do. Yeah, it was it was it was get in your face and shove the chairs and I didn't shove the chair. You pull up the video. I move the chair. not shove the chair and move the chair in my direction so that you can look at me in my eyes because I think that in order to have proper empathy, you should probably look at someone in their eyes. It was definitely a bit of a shove. It's It's not funny. It's true. I I was like, "Okay, well, if he wants to look at me in my face and and mock me, like, okay, like at least you're looking at me, not while I'm turned around going to leave." Well, you were doing things which were mockworthy. And no, you weren't turned around to leave. You were just being myself. standing there yelling at me and I mocked you to your face. You weren't leaving and I mocked you. You forget the part where you turned to me and started started to started to lay into me and so I mocked you and then you flew around the table, shoved the chair, got right in my face. Right. Put your face down. I did not clench your face. The loss in your mind. Losing losing losing your mind. Right. I was not losing my mind. You were losing your mind. And then I thought it was interesting how when this is like woman revisionist history. I thought No, you know what's funny is that if I was a man, you would not be so audacious because No, I you're right. I would out the window, right? That's true. I would have just thrown you right out. You would have thrown No. Okay. So, let me let me No. If I was a bigger man than you, you would not flap your mouth like that because you know that I am less powerful than you. Most men That's why you're doing that. Do you realize that I was in I was in an ordeal kurfuffle in Miami, Florida with a guy who was shocker who a guy who was massive roid raged out of his mind and he was threatening to do bodily harm to me live on a stage right next to me. I didn't back down an inch. I don't give a if you're a man or you're not a man. No, I'm not arguments. Argument arguments are arguments when people go crazy and try to make them physical. I did not go crazy. I got to vouch. And just to vouch for Andrew, the man in question was a large a large man, bald. I'm not saying that to himself, but he he was blasted in tattoos and he was an exconvict and he was massive. Massive. Huge huge dude. I'm not trying I'm not talking to I'm just saying. And uh Andrew Andrew looked him in the face. I don't even know if you looked at him. You're just like whatever. I'm not even scared. And Andrew wasn't scared at all. To be fair, it was Florida and Andrew was armed with a firearm. But I'm with a firearm everywhere. So there is that because it's just generally speaking a good idea. Especially for women. I don't disagree with that except usually they don't get sufficient training and so their gun gets used against them. But but I don't disagree. I prescriptively think that women should probably carry firearms. I think it's a good idea. But that aside, uh I didn't run and get in your face. I didn't run over to you. I didn't go into your Now, I want you to view it view it this way. If you were sitting there and I did the same thing, how would I be viewed? No, but I do want to say that you are stronger and there is that power. Oh, I see. So, you can do whatever you want to me because I can't because I can't do harm to you. But I didn't I did not touch you. So, I think it's weird that you framed it as a sword. Because you're banking on female. I did not throw anything near you. So, you're banking on female privilege. The idea is I can do whatever I want to you because the public appearance is if you did something to me, right? You would be you would you would be viciously attacked for hurting the poor the poor little girl who who didn't do nothing except run over and get in your face and talk about If I wanted to play victim, then I wouldn't have asked you to come outside with me and to talk about it. I wasn't trying to play victim. No, no. Do you understand how it sounds when somebody says, "Let's go outside when they're upset." Do you think that that sounds like they want to have rational discourse or do you think that that sounds like they want to physically tangle with each other? We would have talked about it and then if you felt that that that was appropriate and and that's what had then there definitely would have had to be consent on both sides. It just uh it just sounded to me like um it it sounds to me like a bunch of excuse making. You deserve it. Okay. It's totally it's totally appropriate. If you if the roles were reversed, that wouldn't be okay, but I can do it to you because you're stronger than me, so therefore it's okay. Did I Did I hit you? Did I Did I Did I You definitely shove my chair. Yeah, I shoved it or did I pull it? Yeah. If again, if I walked over here to where you are and pulled your chair and got in your face, but didn't actually touch you, what would the perception be? That's because you're because what the argument earlier was that you are stronger than I am, right? So therefore, you're justified where I'm not. No. So you are using that against me because you think that because I ran over to you. No, you think that I'm not going to say anything because of course that's emotion is important. You can't just I'm saying that's something that if if you're if you're just talking crap. Yeah. Then whether I'm a man or a woman Yeah. would it make sense that you'd be sort of antagonizing the person sort of inciting Yeah. some sort of response. That's what happens. It's called a tit for tat. That's how it works. But it didn't seem tit for tat. It seemed like I made a comment about a thought that you had. Yeah. You were trying to take part. You were trying to take part where I just sat there and took it. You're trying to take parting shots where I sat there and took it. You wanted to get your That's why you went over to the mic and were like, "You're all small dick men." It's the same You're trying to get your dunks in for your parting shots and I didn't let you have your parting shot. You got upset. You ran over here cuz you didn't get your parting shot. Freaked out. Embarrassed yourself. made yourself look bad. And now your argument to me is, "Well, Andrew, it's true. If you came over and did that to me, it would have looked terrible and awful, but it's okay. I can do it." Well, because you're stronger than me, so therefore, I'm justified doing horrible things to you that you're not justified doing to me. That's literally your argument right now. Just pointing that out. I want to say that you what you did would be legally considered harassment, especially in a workplace. No, it's not. No, it isn't. way more than what you're saying, me being assaulting. No, I guarantee you that it's it's not going to be considered harassment for me to make fun of your voice. It definitely is going to be considered battery if you come over and shove my chair and get in my face. I promise. Huh? Shove or pull. It doesn't matter. How did you Wait. Am I applying force to hurt or am I applying force to direct? But the chair moved this way. If you pulled it, it would have gone towards you. It was a shove. Is this considered a a workplace? No, because I know the laws on on that. In addition to that, nobody here, you're not employees. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's that was my question. So, it wouldn't be considered a workplace harassment. So, then what are we if we're not and and just to be clear, let's independent contractors. Just to be clear, even if we were to grant that, your conduct would have been deemed workplace harassment. And by the way, it's completely legal, completely legal to make fun of people at work. You can get fired. That's true. But it's not illegal. None of that has to do with um disability. Nope. You can make fun of people with disabilities at work. Sue two people for that and won a bunch of money. Were they above you in Station? Wait, we Yeah. And that's why it doesn't it doesn't matter. Yeah. Yes, it does. If if I'm at work and there's some chick there's some chick with a disability and I'm like working on a conveyor or something, I can look over and make fun of her. Hold on. I we don't need to get into like discussion. Okay. I need to do a couple of people for anything. Hold on. Because we have people joining the panel, I need to do some seating adjustments so we get everybody in frame. Uh you stay where you are. Priscilla, can you can you scoot your chair that way and then I need you to scoot as far that way? You guys are going to be like leg and then uh scoot your mic too, please, so we can just get all y'all in frame properly. One sec, guys. Okay, I think we're good. Okay. Uh yeah. Oh, did you have something, Saf? She doesn't have a microphone. Oh. Oh. Can Wait. So, I need you to have good discipline tonight. I'm going to I'm less nervous. Just can you scoot your microphone to the edge of the table? And then just leave it there. So, if you want, you can put a microphone on the table for you. There should be one down there somewhere down here on the ground. What number is that, Andrew? Just typing it. Where are they located? Uh, do you see how get a drink? Hi everybody. By the way, that's that would be the correct one then I think. Oops. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So then just put that right in front of you. Put it directly straight in front of you. Straight in front of you. Like center it. It's kind of a interesting way to do a panel, but uh but here we are. Here we are. Uh, okay. So, uh, guys, if you want, get a 100red in for a read, 200 for a TTS. Would appreciate it, guys. Like the video. Twitch.tv whatever. And then uh if you want, you can uh Venmo cash app, whatever. Pod. Well, okay. So, let's uh I guess skip that. Anyway, making fun of people, not a crime. Definitely shoving their seat or getting in their face. Yeah, that that's arguably a crime. mocking to where it incites hostility or not a crime with Yes, it is. Look it up. Well, why don't we just look it up? Do you know what the First Amendment is? Freedom speech. Yeah, freedom of speech. It's unabbridged. It means it it protects hate speech, too. I can go out on the street right now in front of a bunch of death people or homosexuals and be like, "Hey, you blah blah blah blah blah blah blah." Right? I could be like, "Hey, you blah blah." And they can't do it's not a crime. Now, those guys could get really pissed. They could be really upset, but it's not a crime. I don't want to talk about that. No. Yeah. I don't I don't care about what your preference is for what you want to talk about because I want to talk about this. I I would like to I would like to discuss why you think it's okay to I would like to based on based on why. Do you want to know why? Yeah. Okay. Let me tell you why. Okay. I think that everyone grows up differently. That whole conversation precipitated from you trying to present an argument that the C-word, which I actually thought was a woman's I thought that's what you guys meant of the C word because that would be my anyone's natural when you say Cword that's what you would think. I did think that. Well, hold on. But maybe that's because you guys weren't paying attention because the context immediately before the C-word was brought up was related to the nword and we were talking about race. So, I don't know how you could I don't know why you're asking for clarification on that because if you were listening to the rest of the conversation, he he referenced uh talking about the n-word and it was about race. So, and it's clear you knew because the words came out of your mouth. You knew what the other Cword was. So, that's my confusion. In any case, we don't want you to say either of the two Cwords because the plat not because me and Andrew if this was offstream and you wanted to say any of that stuff or we're it was a different platform. We didn't have an objection as it pertains to like the use of those words, but we have to the platforms have rules and guidelines for monetization reasons. Some of them are stricter than others. Tik Tok's notorious for this. Uh, it's about the platform, not And you got confused there. You're like, "Oh, why aren't we allowed to say the Cword in like a general?" No, it's because of the platform. Yeah, we don't personally care. But I don't need to explain to you. And in fact, in the pre-show instructions, we do explicitly say uh for our own guidelines and because of the platform's guidelines, avoid these topics. Don't say these words. You were on the show with Sav uh two Sundays ago or whatever and then you were on this week. We went over the pre-show information. Don't use slurs. Here's a couple slurs to avoid. And we say including but not limited to. And so you when we were messaging in the Instagram DMs, you're like, "Well, did you explic explicitly tell me not to say the C-word?" The problem with that is is if I were to do that, the um you realize how many different slurs there are? Like there's there's hundreds of different slurs. It would not be practical for us in a pre-show environment to like first off even if we listed every single slur not to say, which would be in the hundreds, if not thousands, nobody would remember each individual. No one would commit to memory hundreds or thousands of slurs to not say. So, we say, "Don't say these slurs, including, but not limited to the, uh, well, I'm not going to say it. The R slur, uh, the Fbomb, as you dropped it, um, uh, the N-word, those are like kind of the basic ones that could come up." But in any ways, it just seemed kind of strange that you're like, "Well, you didn't tell me not to say it." But actually, if you watch the video back origin, like in the moment when you're like, "What's the C word?" I was like, "Don't say it." I said that. I said, "Don't say it." And then you said it. And he did drop the furler and he knew you weren't supposed to do that. And the rler after I was already told to leave, which I'm sorry because that was vindictive that. Yeah. You did it maliciously because you like, "Oh, now I know not to say these words. Let me just try to his business." No, I'm very I already initiated this whole thing with the apology for that. So, do you forgive or not? Uh, do I forgive you? I mean, I'm over it. I I guess it it was a couple days ago. I don't know if I forgive you for it, but I'm over it. Like, I'm not I'm not going to linger on it. Aside from this conversation we're having, I I just was shocked. And when it was coming out of my mouth, it was more like me like externally realizing what what you meant. Like I was processing it and saying it at the same time. Saying what? The C word. I was like, "Is that what you mean?" So it came out as I was thinking it. I was like, "What?" No, no, no. But so if you watch the video back, there was like an initial moment where you were like, "Wait, what is the C word? What is And I was like, "No, no, no, no. Don't say it." Right. I said it there. And then of course the pre-show information were like don't say slurs and then and then you got a there was a little bit of heat going on in a couple different directions and then you're like and then you drop it and then you got the kick. It was an extroverted thought. It was just I was just it was an extroverted thought. Okay. Well, yeah. I do want to say that saying that all your viewers are tiny. You they actually I did I did a poll and they all have huge penises. I do want to say andrew has the biggest of them all. You can send pics in. It's giant. It's Is this sexual harassment? Is this workplace harassment? Andrew, I don't. Holy Are you gonna send pics and I'll let her know. File civil rights. I already did. Oh James Ston is on on the case. Um, but yeah, all my It's true. I In fact, I even required verification. So, they all had to send me a photo, too, my viewers, so I could verify. I You think I'm I I can't just take their word for I got some verification. So, I pulled my viewers. I was like, "How big like is it you know?" And they told me and then they sent photos and then also I got some labia pictures too which and there is a predomination of large labia women also because I'm a large labia advocate. I I'm You're not digging yourself out of that hole, bro. But okay. Uh anyways, uh you're just kind of like in that one. Oh yeah. You you were sorry. Do you just have like a bunch of pictures of all of their stuff? Do you have a dick room? I I print out what what's that camera that used to print out? Polaroid. I print out Polaroids of It's just um red string connecting it to Yes. Yes. Yeah. And I categorize it by like does it slope like the slope direction and then like any Okay, this is kind of weird. Uh, wait. So, okay. You you were going to say something about how you I don't know if it was about to be an apo a but you're saying and I also said that your viewers are teeny dick misogynist or something or whatever. And what were you going to say? I Yeah. Are you allowed to say that? How about P? Say PP. Okay. Shrimp. I like the Yeah, that was very blanketed of me and you taking the poll. I mean, that just shows. Yeah, there's your proof that they have huge that they're hung. It's crazy. It's crazy, man. Which Yeah, it's crazy. You know what else did you say? Like they're also misogynists, right? Are you Oh, no. Okay. So, hold on. There's a couple other things to break down here. As I was trying to get you to leave, but you were like, "No, I'm going to take my time to waste your time or whatever." And as you're trying to leave, you're like, "What? You hate women to me?" Mhm. Um, do is that what you think? I'm not offended if you think that, but is that what you think? Where were we when I said that? We were standing in the hallway right there and I was like, "Can you leave?" And you're like, "No, let me take a really long time to put my shoes on to waste more of your time." And then you're like, and then you're like, "You just hate women." This is going to sound like not true, but I did black out for a lot of what I was saying to you after after I left. You blacked out? Like as in like I know you're recording. I think your accountability blacked out. I think your accountability also blacked out. I don't know. I completely and totally take accountability for making fun of you when you were making parting shots. Totally. I 100% take accountability. Absolutely not. Then absolutely not. Then I'm definitely not going to apologize. Well, the the person wrong does the apology. Yeah, both of us. Not the person who's not wrong. I would say both of us did something wrong. Uh, no. Then also where I come from and what and like I wanted to say it's about to be where I come from men men do X. It's not about men or women and that's what's silly. Okay, here we go. Go ahead. I wish it didn't have to be men versus women, but I'm just saying every single person has a different Well, how can it not be when you you're like my argument for why it's perfectly acceptable to lose my mind and do and do horrible things to you is okay based on the fact that you're stronger than me. I'm just pointing that out. But anyway, go ahead. No, because I after I left, I saw what you said about it and you were like, "Look, she was looking for things to hit me with." It's like she was you were looking for things. There was a bunch of things to hit you with. If I was looking for things to hit you with then and I wanted to hit you then don't you think that I would have done that? So I think that's total slander. You know the thing is the thing the thing is is like there was there was multiple she this is what she was looking at. So there was there was multiple so there's multiple women at the table who agreed with that statement. Three. And the reason they agreed with it is because like uh I'm pretty good with understanding people's body language. talked to thousands of people all over the world, right? And uh I you get a familiarity for what a person's kind of thinking, what it is that they're they're kind of moving towards. And the thing is is like it was very obvious to most of us. Now, your rational sense may have kicked in and been like, "Okay, maybe doing that is one step too far." But you were definitely looking around like you were going to throw something for sure. I promise you that. I Well, how do you know you you were blacked out? How do you know? I said when I was when I was just talking. How do I know that you were not seconds away from blacking out here and grabbing something? I mean, you're just prone to blackouts when you're upset. His penis. What if you blacked out and sad him? When when I left Rachel would have really had to come down. You started saying that I was trying to find something to hit you with. There's plenty of stuff to hit you with. Look, there's glasses there. There there were those little crystal things. There's so many things. Yes, I'm I'm aware that you didn't do the action. That doesn't mean it didn't look as though you were going to, which was my claim. Okay. Well, that Well, it wasn't true, so I'm just letting you know. Yeah, I don't know about that. I'm not convinced. Okay. Yeah. I remain unconvinced. Unconvinced. Yeah. I think that uh I think that if you could have in the moment gotten away with throwing something at my head, you definitely would have. There's plenty of stuff to throw at your head. Yes. But you not doing it doesn't mean that if you thought you could have gotten away with it, you wouldn't have. Nor that you weren't looking for something and then just thought better of it. I wasn't. Well, I don't know. Who knows? Cuz you blacked out after you left. You know, you don't even remember. You don't remember what you said. You don't remember your version of events aren't so clear cuz you weren't conscious for some of them. You know, like maybe maybe the part maybe the part where you were looking for things to throw at me, you just missed because in that moment you blacked out for just a few seconds. I didn't look. How would you know if you blacked out? Well, first of all, it was all being filmed, so I think we would know if I picked something up to We should watch the film because it definitely Can we? Sure. We can pull it up. Yeah, it definitely looked We can pull it up. You'll see. You'll see. Okay. just want to say what I was about to say so that you don't think it's men versus women. I was going to say each individual person has their own in path and how they were brought up and each circumstance is different and that whole conversation precipitated by you were about to present an argument of which is worse the cword or the n-word. I wanted to say even presenting that argument contributes to systemic o the systemic oppression of of black people in the US. And you about to drop the n-word right there. No, I thought you were about to systemic oppression of Yeah, it seemed she was about. But anyway, so but I also want to say that my mom was affiliated to to uh Crips, which is a a predominantly black gang. Mhm. and and how and I want to say deep in my sub I don't think it's correct that did they jump her in I I don't know I just want to say deep deep in my subconscious it's like the whole thing is if you want to talk if you want to talk poop then then you're going to it's like you know what I mean like don't just go around and I feel like as the and I want to say so your mom taught you no I want to say to violently assault people what did your mom teach you to mock people for the It's insane. I I Okay, I You know what? You know what what's happening? It's so funny to watch this in real time. So, here's what's happening here. So, you take a a woman, right? She's small. She's unassuming. She seems like it's not a big problem. This or that. Then you take a minor squabble where the woman goes crazy. Does a bunch of Hang on. Does a bunch of which clearly is insane, right? Loses her mind to the point where they black out. Come back the next day and then gaslight you. literally gaslight you. Listen, this is like so many relationship stories like this. Listen, baby. It wasn't really that bad. It wasn't what you think. You're misremembering things. Honestly, I'm just a dainty little little thing. You You can trust me. I just did. And then the difference though here, we have the It's like impossible to gaslight me because I've watched it 30 times. You were an I rate lunatic. Pull it up. You were Look, look at yourself. I rate lunatic. I don't think it's an apology or accountability if you like make excuses for it. Like putting in like we do not apologize to him and take no accountability. Exactly. Don't apologize to Andrew. I don't apologize to Andrew. I apologize to Brian for what? For violating the contract in your rules. I would never have filled out and and also for for making little jabs on my way out. Okay. The jab. And what about the interrupting? Not following the rules. and for not um following the proper structure, the flow. But I I want to say you guys want to arm wrestle or something like Wait, no. That's Let's not do that. Um No. You know what though? You should we play the video? Yes. I think Wait. Yeah. We Yeah. What? Do you have an edited version of it? Well, it'll be on this. It'll be after the Okay. the bombs. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have something before though we play the video? Watch it on the big screen. You'll see. Right. I just want to say that you Wait, actually, do you have something to say? Oh, no. I'm just I just don't want to watch the video. Are you laughing at her, bro? No, I'm just embarrassed to watch. Are you laughing at my own girl? Why are you laughing at Priscilla, bro? I'm doing Yo, we will both match you, son. What? You go. She had training. Let's go. True. That's what she said. She had training. No, I I want to say that is gang that is misrepresentation and I felt that you just being I felt like you were improperly using this is a this is a power dynamic is it not like this is an power dynamic. I'm just a guest. You're not a guest. You're like a co would he be like your co-host? Andrew is actually my dentured servant. I have a contract from his great great great greatgrandfather enslaving him to me and he's this is slave labor here. And so Andrew um least amount of power then yeah he's like yeah he like cleans the bathroom after the show and like cleans up all the the women leave their their nails their fake nails everywhere. Disgusting. He cleans it up. There's hair on the floor and Sometimes I the amount of the bathroom's all up after the show. I blame it on the women. Totally up. Whoa. And uh Yeah. So he's in he's in there after the show like uh what's that what's that girl uh with the red hair from like the 20s in that movie. This is some burrito revisionism right here. What is that? Wait. No. I'm telling you. I'm talking about like I love this. He's like Annie. He's like Annie there like it's a hard knock life for us. It's a hard knock life for us. And he's just in the bathroom cleaning. It's crazy. I don't even give him a Swiffer. I'm like use a I have a toothbrush in there that he has to use. And that's how he cleans the bathroom. Like some military You need to get him the Annie wig now and make him wear that. So power dynamics like it's crazy. Like you guys coming in like you Yeah. I have to see see all this alcohol he's drinking. For him to tolerate doing this job, he needs to be tanked out of his mind because it's just brutal. So, okay, I get that. Okay, I'll shut up. Okay, neither of us are are I feel like we both You're right. I was taking sort of little jabs and I feel like but I hadn't taken any of you. Right. And I and and I'm sorry for that. Yeah. I just want I just want the record to show that you actually provoked me. So the the argument in defense for your uh whatever these weird simp goons have been making on your behalf, which is you provoked her. No, the opposite's true. You provoked me and all I did was barely make fun of you. It was like a little All I did was mock by it. Well, it's not only minimized, but listen, that is like the lowest tier form of mockery. Just kind of making fun of somebody, right? when they when they're acting hysterical and you kind of mock their voice. It's the lowest tier. It should not take you from zero. Hysterical. Yes. Hysterical. Happened after you started antagonizing me. Oh, I see. No accountability again. So words can So I can control you with words. It's like I did a jab and then So I can control you with words and then you punched me and and you know it's like I punched you. No, I did a jab. Mhm. Sorry. Keep going. I was just I was interacting with the chat, but Rachel wants to call in. So, that's that's the wife and I feel like you she needs to talk to you like woman to woman, lady to lady. Oh, your wife. Mhm. Oh. Oh, that's real accountability right there if you do it. Don't point at me. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Yo, she might Dude, she might freak out. You're gonna Jen, I Your chair is going to have trouble soon. Just to to paint me in a light that I was going crazy when when I told you to look at me in my face. No, you didn't tell me to invoke just a shred of empathy from you. Yeah. You don't get Listen, you don't get to force me to empathize with you. Do you like Do you understand how absurd that sounds? Do you understand how absurd it sounds to say you need to have empathy? It's a It's like paradoxical to say I did a jab and then and then and then you went below the belt. I mocked you and then I mocked you. I did a jab. You went below the belt. Yeah, I mocked you and you made it a personal thing because instead of actually having a proper rebuttal to what? There was no rebuttal to have sensitivity. We're supposed to have a debate while you're walking out of the room. Okay, you're right. You're right. It's a parting shot. So, you made a parting shot. I made a parting shot. The difference is I didn't go haywire and ballistic. Have self-control. didn't lose my mind when you came over here, right? Started screaming. I actually, right, to decelerate you from going to the next level of Looney Tunes Land walked away even though I was totally justified in provoking you further. Oh, and then I just want Oh, how I don't want to say pathetic. I just want to say after I left and you're like, why didn't any of you come to my defense? True. Oh, fof off. You know, floof. See what a lot of empathy you want from me, not a lot of empathy from you. No, because you're not understanding how you are antagonistic. Yeah. The whole world doesn't revolve around your version of empathy. And the whole world doesn't revolve around your feelings. The whole world revolves around facts and evidence of what really happened. Here's what really happened. You obnoxiously turned around and you obnoxiously turned around flubbing up. You obnoxiously turned around, talked a bunch of And so And so I mocked you and you lost your mind. That's objectively what happened. So you did it twice. So what? So am I So is it okay that I say you're crazy right now? You're just unhinged because you keep on going against the rules. What rules? You just keep on cursing. Cursing is not against the rules. You can say You can say those. You're allowed to say You can't say certain slurs. You can say You can say You can say things like that. What? Yeah. Yeah. Well, so obviously I don't other word. All right. Yeah, I do agree that I didn't break no rules. What that I don't like people making fun of my voice. So I agree that that and saying that you are either physically or mentally um have something wrong with you. Yeah, that's exactly right. Look at Jess Gerald. He's so basically she's saying I'm sorry you made me do that. That's That's your accountab I'm sorry that you accountability too. So I did a jab so that you could have me person. It's really not ableist. I have a lisp and then you totally undercut my the perception. That's funny because I didn't make fun of you with a lisping voice. I know I mocked I mocked your what I did was I mocked you using a childlike voice. You said she sounded like she was deaf and you were making Yes, I was making fun of her voice but I wasn't making fun of trying to make you look better. And then you're painting me as a crazy person. Is she deaf? Clearly not. Is it still the same? Clearly clearly not. Even though Okay. Do you know after that happened, people were actually If it's not harassment and it's not inciting violence, then why were people coming to my page and telling me that I better be careful? Cuz who? Oh, they're threatening you. Yeah. This is my fault. How do you think that I called? I thought I got a bunch of death awareness. That was Do you think that I called each of these people and told them to go to your page and harass you? You have a responsibility to sort of Do you not? Oh my god. I have literally a million fans. What responsibility do I have to a million people? So, he doesn't care about the messages that he's sending you guys. I guess he has no responsibility towards actually um giving you correct information. He's just trying to incite contempt for women. I see. So because what if we all had a good time? Do things. What if on this show everyone had a good time? That would show that men on this show do have a good time often. Well, that's true. Such a misogynist, Andrew. I just But that is your So I had actually the exact just so you know, I had the exact opposite argument. I said I take full accountability for the fact that I mocked you and I just gave you an account for the tip for tat for why I did. The distinction here is that your argument is Andrew, you made me do it. You made me do it. That's exactly what you did. You just said tit for tat. No, no, no. You didn't make me do the tit for tat. But what you're saying is that I provoked you to the point where you just had to lose your mind. Come over here. Get in my face. Totally my fault. My mind. Watch. And to say that I if I would have I don't know why Brian won't pull up this video. He's saying if I wanted to hit you, then I would have hit you. Uhhuh. Wait, Rachel, we tried calling on Discord. No, if I wanted to hit you, I would have tried to stop Andrew's Discord. No, can you lo and also I would have gotten your consent if I wanted to do that. Consent? Yeah, because there is mutual combat laws in California. We could Oh, I don't know that. No, I don't. Why don't we just Google it? I think in Seattle you can do that. No, that's here too. You can have Washington. You can like Washington. Wait, Oregon? I think I don't think there's mutual I think so in California. Yeah. somebody just has to ask me if they can hit me and then I say yeah and then they well like you could for example if you were like at a bar district or whatever and you're in Seattle or Washington or whatever and there's a cop you can be like hey me and that guy we want to do mutual combat and they're not going to like arrest you now like once the guy's knocked out and you if you start beating him and he's knocked out then they'll intervene but they'll let you like you can fight in front of the cops and they'll let you do it. Okay, that makes sense. To a point. To a point. Yeah. Like if they're knocked out on the ground, then it's over. But um Okay. Uh Rachel, we're I tried to call you on through Andrew's Discord. I don't know if you there's a different way. Rachel, can you maybe She's pretty rough. Uh Rachel, can you message me on Instagram? She's way better than me. Uh yellow shirt needs anger management. Okay. She did black out during that moment. Yeah, she blacked out. Better be careful. Uh uh oh. Um, you are the definition of abusive and narc. You hit a man, he's gonna let Oh, if you hit a man, he's gonna lay you out. See, that is also Oh, these are below the threshold. That is also That's weird. I feel like I said, if I was a bigger man, you would if I was a bigger If I was a big man, you have a penis. If I was a man and I was bigger than him, I'm sorry. He would not have done the same thing. So, that is used. So, I'm also using your same logic. Prove it. So, who was the aggressor with the tattoo guy at at that case? I mocked him incessantly constantly. I was You were the aggressor? I don't. So, you have a history. Do you mean the provoker? I would say Yeah. I would say that I definitely blood. Yeah. I disputed his worldview first. Yeah. Disputed his world view. Andrew, I don't think that's provocation to like threats of physical violence. You were super respectful until he became disrespectful much like this. He was the But Wes Wson was the provoker. Sure. Okay. You disagreed with them. You disagree. You were perfectly respectful. You disagreed with him like I am with everybody until they go crazy. He threatened you with Stop calling me crazy then. Well, I'm sorry, but you I could call you a lot of things. You act like a If we're allowed to cuss. Let's not get into like a screaming match, insulting back and forth. Wait, Priscilla, can I have you scoot your mic that way just a tad and just keep it No, you can. I mean, you can hit me with it. Tell me what you think about me. Okay. Before Before you guys do that, uh, we have a chat. Oh, can you unmute over on the keyboard? Just hit the mute button at the very top of the keyboard. It's on the keyboard. On the keyboard. Very top in confronting Andrew. Brian was justified in the kick. Two wrongs don't make a right, but three lefts make a right. Little laugh, love. Glad you came back. Uh, Priscilla fan, the beginning part was just what Priscilla did was justified in confronting Andrew. Sorry, our audio was muted. Um, there you go. You have a fan, Priscilla. The thing is though is uh she was I think if it happened in reverse I'd be in jail right now. That's all I'm going to say. Well, I would literally be in jail. Oh, yeah. You would be But but I also feel that way that you would be in jail. What? Yeah. It just Do you know Do you know that the Santa Barbara Police Department contacted me and I told them not to press charges? Really? Yeah. They contacted you? Yes. That sounds true. And they contacted him? That sounds very truthful. They they they contacted both of us. They did. So, they're just big fans of the whatever show. Probably somebody called them. Somebody called. Somebody called and I got a call from uh I mean I have the voicemail, but I mean I'm not going to play it. Did someone call the police then? Probably somebody Yeah, somebody called the police and reported. I think you told them to. I'm just saying that if the reverse had happened, you did. You said someone called They wouldn't be calling you. I don't think you really be in this building. my ass would be getting kicked all the way out to the squad car and I'd be in prison right this second. That's what would have happened. And so it's really funny to me that you think you can put me in a compromising position because well Andrew, you're bigger, so therefore it's justified. That's really what your argument reduces to. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Cuz if the same thing happened in reverse, I'd be in jail. We all know I'd be in jail. They all know I'd be in jail. Everyone here knows I'd be in jail, including you. I'd be in jail. And so the thing is is like it's a total double standard cuz they mocked your place. It's like I'm wondering if it depends on the size of the man if he would be in jail or not. No, who cares? Like why would that matter? If they're really really big, you're still not justified in doing horrible things to them because it makes you feel good. Like do you get that? It doesn't matter if they're seven feet tall. You still can't go get in their face. And if they do that to you, they go to prison. That's where they go. They go to jail. I'd be in jail. And they would have kicked my ass on the way out, by the way. They would have and probably justifiably so, right? They would have kicked my ass here. They would have cuffed my ass. They would have thrown my ass in a squad car. My ass would be in a jail cell right this second. Guarantee it. Everybody here knows it. There's nobody's confused about it. The only person that's confused about it, you. I would never put you in that compromising position or myself. But you felt justified because I'm a man. Because you hate men. No, you felt hate men. You're just painting me as someone that I'm not. You're like a crazy person. Total monster. Like you did a monstrous thing. Take no accountability. Now you're coming back in trying to gaslight people and pretend you're the good guy. This seems like projection. Yeah, it's projection. Pretend you're the good guy. Even though I'd be in jail if I did the exact same thing. You can just wave the behavior away. It's like maybe I should have pressed charges. I don't know. Maybe maybe that would have been the best thing to do, but I didn't because it was all on camera. That's why you didn't. And it's pretty clear what the actual law is. You know what? In the future, this is the third time this has happened where a woman has assaulted me. And for you painting it as an assault, next time I think in the future, I am actually going to follow through with the charge pressing cuz they just don't give it. I did not touch you. Like they'll acknowledge that they did this thing that you would be in jail if you did the thing, but they still don't care. They're just like whatever. How about I forgive you and we're fine. No, forgiveness requires accountability. That's how forgiveness works. You don't go to someone and say, "Hey, I'd like you to forgive me for this thing that I didn't do to you." I think we both um got upset and I I wasn't upset. I'm still not upset. So that's just how you act. Yes, that's how he does this. He tries to Yeah, if you're if you're if you're a dick, I'm a dick and if you're cool, I'm cool. The I had a respectful debate with both of these gals and they're here. They were totally cool. She DM'd me beforehand and was like, "Hey, I don't want to get into like some personal flame war and I said, "Yeah, me either. I'd rather do deal with the ideas." It was fantastic. That's what I wanted. You're the common denominator ideas, but you're right. I did make a jab on the way out, but you painting me as someone as I'm not is not okay because I love with capitals. I love men. I love men. You love to put them in compromised position where they can go to jail. No, I don't. I think it's funny because the reverse is that you wouldn't have done that if I was a bigger man. So, you're right. You see how this is right here? If I had just stood up in the wrong way. I had to actually stand up in a specific way. I had to make sure that I moved the proper way to stand up to get away from you because I was afraid if I stood up too quick and it just bulled you over. Just me standing up, I'd be in jail. So you can actually see in the in the video me shifting slightly to get out of the chair. I'm shifting my body weight this way away from you. I stand up super slowly and away just so that the very appearance of like oh my arm brushed against her, right? Uh wasn't there so I didn't end up in jail? You're assuming that I'm the type of person that would that would do something like that and that would and would make you person who blacks out. You just went to my You just went to my face and said, "You hate men. You hate men." Well, I can't I the The only thing that I can draw the only conclusion I can draw with your double standard is that you hold the There is no double standard. There's a difference of There's It's We're different. We're different. Yes. And you think that difference enables you to to get in men's faces and assault them? And I don't think so. No. You think that you could run your mouth because you know that I'm not physically strong. Why do you think if you're a man I wouldn't run my mouth run my mouth to men all the time and you know what most of the time have you had your most the time they laugh and the other thing is is that men men they don't do the that you did they don't go like they don't make little passive aggressive jabs and they debate they get in there they debate yeah then they if they don't do that then why did you make a little passive aggressive jab at me cuz you no you made the passive you made the passive aggressive jab aggressive aggressive jab it was aggressive Aggressive, not passive. So, I'm going to let you pick Priscilla. You're talking about pressing charges. Wait, Priscilla, don't It's okay. No, no, I said I should have. I'm not going to, but I should have. He's not. Priscilla, I have two presents for you. Really? Don't play with me. You get to pick. You get to unwrap one. Well, both of the presents, but you get to pick the order. I have Rachel, Andrew's wife, on the Discord. Is that a present? In some way, it will be. And then two, uh, we can So, it's either Rachel and then the video, like us reacting to the video, or video and then, uh, these are not presents. I feel like it's a present. Can I know why I'm talking to your wife who I've never met in my life? Because I feel like getting a woman's Because that what you do, what you do to me affects her, too. Don't you think there's a conflict of interest here? I'm sorry. Didn't you just say I'm a big evil scary man and that if I was a woman the other there would be other results. It's like well now you have the perfect opportunity. Not one time did I call you big Andrew. She has to stick up for her man, you know? Well then well well then even that then how how could you be intimidated then? What do you mean? Wait, Rachel, are you uh we tried calling but I don't know if you were all ready. Let me uh is she uh on the call over there? Can you see her or no? Okay, we'll just we'll just wait a little bit. Uh here. Let me just read this chat here while we uh Ken says, "Or you know what? Let's have Sav read it." Sav, can you read this one? Oh god. Oh, wait. No, don't. Watch it back, lady. You should I'll read it. She does sound like a death bed. He mocked you because you deserve to be mocked. Watch it back, lady. You should apologize to Andrew. I think we should take this time to give my son Maverick a shout out. Uh, not the women, please. Oh, well, I wonder why you don't want the women to speak. That's weird. Okay. And definitely not misogynistic podcast. He's the best guest there is. MAGA. Did you vote for Trump? I think that they're Am I allowed to say I think that Kanye? I mean, what what do you mean? I think that they're all PDF files. So, that's what I think. Uh, we're not going to get into that. And good job for using the the change. Wait, do you want to do a shout out for Maverick really quick, Andrew? Uh, well, was it his birthday or something? He says, "Uh, we should give this time to give my son Maverick a I mean, well, shout out shout out to your son, Kenneth Maverick." Shout out to you, Maverick. Are you going to do a Sill thing, too? Or I don't I don't know. I don't know. Just trying to stay on theme here. Wait, I have a question. The theme is Adam Nazi. Well, you're okay with uh that's what they call this slur for disabled people. So that's that makes you a a snaz. I mean, if you're okay with Can I say something? Making fun of people is nowish. Can I feel like the Nazis were pretty respectful ultimately? They did horrible things, but they were respectful about it. I really do want to try to bridge the gap here. That's nice. Bridge the gap with my wife. He He's going for a smoke. He's coming back. He's coming back. He's going out for a quick also like to go for that too since we're both equal guests. Well, I can't have you. But he is the slave boy with Yeah, we I can't have you guys out there on the same at the same moment. Why do you feel like like tempted to do something? It's awkward. Not to share the bathroom. Okay. Okay. So, um I'm not going to talk to this man's wife if he does if he he he doesn't even want to be next to me. Why would I talk to I don't think he even wants to be next to me. I don't think he wants to be next to me either to be fair. Priscilla, my question for you is like you're a stand-up comedian, right? Yes. And it's like, don't you get heckled? Like, so why I mean, aren't you kind of used to people saying you know? No one has ever said anything like that. Nobody's heckled you. Not like No, I guess not really. I But it does happen. open mic standup or do you do booked gigs? I'll do both. All the Yeah, both. Do they Is there heckling at open mics? I don't I prefer heckling because I'm like, well, if you I normally it just doesn't happen because they have a structured set for them. I get it, right? But I feel like what Andrew was doing was in effect heckling. You know, the only thing he's right that I was, but to paint me in a light that I'm just some crazy lady like and he does and he's invalidating his actions and then minimizing them. I don't think that's very fair. True. Thank you. That's true. This is just what he does. Do we have Rachel? And I hold on. Can you uh try to like hit the call button on the thing? Wait here. Let me Wait. This is even a bit antagonistic. Especially her calling me improper. Wait. So, uh, like, let me judge her. Let's know a little bit about her. We're waiting. Rachel, are you uh are you ready, Rachel, or We tried calling. I don't know what happened. Rachel, is the Discord calling? So, um, you waterboard people. Oh god, she waterboards people, bro. Oh, I need Can you demonstrate on Priscilla? Oh my gosh. Yeah, that's the gave you. You won't do it or Oh, she's got pay. You don't do freebies. Can you give her waterboard? Waver. Can you Can you give her a waterboard freebie? I know you do that for work. Savannah, will you do a waterboard freebie? Uh, will you waterboard Priscilla? Why do I think that's probably it? You can't do that on YouTube. I don't think you can w You know what? I've seen I saw Christopher Hitchens get waterboarded on YouTube. For educational purposes, I think you can do it, but it probably the video probably gets age restricted if you're doing torture techniques. So, wait, what about waterboarding? Did you have another question? How how many different people have you done it to? Um, I would say a fair handful. A fair handful. Can I ask what the cost of water boarding is? Oh, yeah. I I can't give out exact exact numbers. Um, but it it depends. There's a lot of talking that happens beforehand. There's waiverss that get signed and they get boundaries. They get like sexual gratification from it or they just like they just feel brave. Um, but yeah, I mean sometimes, okay, they do. It kind of depends, but Huh. Interesting. Kind of a weird niche. I don't even know how you do that. I don't I I once had a dude DM me asking for me to put on heels and um stomp on his ball. So, didn't do it. But, um, that's crazy. Yeah. He only wanted to give me like 250. He offered a couple grand maybe. No, I'm joking. I could not do that. I couldn't. What? really. And then I found out he was in like all of my friends in boxes. It was just his thing, I guess. Wow. Wow. Do we have her? I think we have her, but I just Okay, here. I'll come back and fix it. So, uh, I'm gonna go. Okay. You guys for like a minute. You guys look into this camera and wink or something. Um, So, um, what I winked I winked it like four times. She did. It was really cute. Thanks. I don't know if we're supposed to keep talking. Rachel, are you there? Yeah, I can hear you guys. Can you hear me? Yes. Hi, Rachel. Can you ask her if we have if she can turn the camera on? Can you turn the camera? Can you turn the camera on or No, I I'm sorry. I can't turn my camera on right now. But I can talk. So, you can enjoy the beautiful picture of me while I tell Priscilla that if she comes anywhere near my husband, she's going to have to deal with me. I'll fly out there and she could try getting in my face and see how tough she feels then. Because I guarantee if it was me sitting across from your ass, you would not have had that kind of energy whatsoever. That is And for you to think that you can physically attack my husband, like get in his face, say you want to take him outside on a national TV show that everyone saw, and then come back in the studio and act like you didn't do nothing. Like, well, he made fun of me. Too bad. Are you a child or are you a grown woman? Have some self-control. And if you can't have some self-control, I'll come over there and teach you some. How about that? Well, Rachel, it sounds like you're a little unhinged. Are you okay? You're the one that's unhinged there, sweet cheeks. I'm not the lunatic who tried to attack a grown man on a live podcast. What the hell was thinking? I'm wondering, are you threatening me on a live podcast? You're saying you're going to fly down here. You're going to teach me a lesson. Yeah, she just says stern talking to a stern talk. That's exactly what I wanted to do when I said I wanted to go outside with Andrew. I just wanted to give him a stern talking to sweet cheeks. You ain't going nowhere with him. And what I'll do is I'll come and get in between you and him so that you can deal with someone your own size. What do you think about that? Now, are you going to calm down and apologize? You are the one who is unhinged and the whole world sees it. The whole world knows it. You sound like a delight. First of all, the life crying your tears. You're completely full of I'm not crying. You're crazy. You have no business doing comedy. You're not funny. Don't do any more. You're not funny. Go get a job at a Oh gosh, Rachel. Okay, because that's that's what you should be doing. You should be like ringing up groceries. You're never going to be a comedian. You're never going to be a podcaster. Do you look down on minimum wage workers? Rachel, I'm making fun of you because you deserve it. Because you're a laughingstock. You're absurd and you're ridiculous. Absurd is true. Yeah. You're not funny. You're not entertaining. Nobody cares about your little Saab story. Nobody cares that your mama was in a gang. Like, what the hell, dude? Like, what the hell? What's wrong with you? Do you not hear yourself? Do you have no self-awareness? Just stop. Right back at you, Rachel. I acted like a lunatic. I physically threatened a man, a grown man. I physically threatened him in front of the whole world. I was wrong. That was stupid. Even if I was upset, I should have controlled myself. That's the correct answer. And if your mother didn't teach you correctly, I'm here to correct your behavior. Now, stop your Uh, is your wife reprimanding me right now? I think. Yes, that's what I'm doing. You made I made it funny. How to behave. You need your mom. You need a mama to come in here and tell you what appropriate behavior looks like. So that's what I'm doing. You're welcome. Now stay the hell away from my husband. Don't go try to smoke out on the balcony with him. Don't you dare get within 20 ft of him or I'll be the one calling the Santa Barbara police. You got it. First of all, I didn't lay a hand on your husband. Painting it as assault was insane. And I did not make a threat. I asked him if he wanted to go out and talk. You want to step outside? What does that sound like? Cash me outside. Catch me outside. How about that? What difference does it make? What? Oh, it makes a big difference. It makes a big difference. Police are calling us asking if we'd like to press charges. It makes a difference. I don't think that's true. Okay. You want to hear Do you Brian can play the message? Sure. Do you not believe it? She doesn't believe it. So, she's still going to double down and act like she did no wrong here. She's still going to act like you making fun of her when she was already acting like a damn fool. You've been Hey, Rachel. Rachel threatening to visit. You've been You've been sick for the last couple days. You need to go back to bed. You've said your peace. You're true. You're right. That's true. I had a few days. But I'm glad I got a chance to talk to this girl and let her know that she's ridiculous. She should never show her face in public again. Don't do podcasting. Don't be a comedian. Just Just go work in an office or something. Okay. You're stay away from Andrew. You're really lovely. Thanks for the talk, Rachel. She's excellent. You're welcome. See you soon, Brian. Any anything final, Rachel? Or is that Oh, I think that's it. I think he understands it pretty well. Well, uh Rachel, I hope you feel better.

Okay, you got to be careful with this one over here, you know. But if you want Pilates every day, who should show their self on the podcast now? Rachel got a 255 lb deadlift for five reps. So, I mean, I ain't no weakling either. Yeah, Rachel's strong, too. Rachel's strong, too, in mind and body. She's got the constitution. But yeah, Rachel, thank you so much for uh calling in.

This donation is for Octopus for everyone for mukbang. I don't have any more octopus. You know what? I'll look on Door Dash. I'll look on Door Dash and see Oh my god. You going to order octopus?

You missed out on You could have been eating octopus with the rest of the girls. Do you know octopus are octopuses are highly highly intelligent? Yeah, I feel bad. But I know like a human. Yeah. Um, how dare you even buy it? That's true. I don't know if you can order octopus at 1000 p.m. in Santa Barbara like a sushi place. You know what? I don't see any. I don't think there's I wasn't ever going to try to hurt you or try to throw anything at you. Okay. Yeah, it's all it's all You know, we could I just don't believe you at all. We could dig through the We could dig through the trash and see if there's like two day old 48 hour old. Just watch the clip, bro. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Um, sorry. What were you saying? Oh, I said, "Are we going to watch it?" Yes. Yeah. Yeah. We're We're gonna pull it up. Yay. All right. Let me just clear the chat. I watched it and I don't feel bad. All right. And painting yourself as the victim is pathetic. So, let's see it. Painting yourself as the victim is what's pathetic. It makes you sick. That's what's pathetic. I have a right to do whatever I want to you because you're bigger than me. That's your do anything to you. Making you look into my eyes and pulling your chair does not constitute assault. Yeah. making you do a thing so that you could be and the only reason and but I just want to say paradoxical how what if we just had like normal rapport like having normal rapport with you I know but what if instead of your your wife basically threatening me she never threatened you I didn't think you were not there when she said I'll come down and show you and teach you and yeah so she's mothering you yeah so then so so she's threatening to have a conversation with you with that's what I was threatening to do. Did Rachel say step outside? Basically, that's what it meant. I'm going to come down there and teach you a lesson. H I think that's in a similar spirit. It was as beating you in a debate. That's a lesson she beating me in a debate. You personally attacked me. No, her as a rebuttal. Her that's how she That's how she does things. She beats people in debates. I'm disappointed in you. I don't care. I don't. It was a There's nothing more disappointing than a gas lighter. That would be you. I'm not You minimizing it at the beginning is a gas lighter to minimize gas. Who got in whose face? Did I get in your face? And then calling me crazy and then acting like it wasn't valid. Who got in whose face? As I should. Who got in? You should have. See what I mean? It's like, what do you do with that? This was you, Priscilla. That was you, bro. Hold on. Let me This was you. Oh, Andrew. Talk Get hit. Talk Get hit. Look, come here. How's it, Andrew? Wait, do the fingers. Do the fingers of the baby. The little like this. Oh, I can't I don't know how to do that. You know, look, I think it was it was spirited. I do not drink alcohol. It was It was a scathing rebuke. A scathing rebuke. I like that. Okay, let's let's watch the uh Do you know how to get it uh pulled up, Mick? I didn't lose control. I was in full control. Yeah, you looked like it. I was I definitely was before. No, I was saying out there when I was talking crap just my in total control and then blacked out. I said that I kind of you know like you know how that goes. You know how it goes when you're like in total control and so angry that you black out. So just you know totally. just not give any information to you then because you're just going to use it against me. Because I was being honest cuz if I had blacked out in here then I would say I blacked out in here but that's not what happened. It's nice that you're honest about the details of the exchange but then dishonest about your conclusions about your responsibility. No, I said I did I actually did take accountability. I said we both did something wrong. That's what I said. Okay. Well, who did something wronger? No, I don't think so. Well, I just asked who did who did something wronger? Yeah. I'm taking accountability for my part and you're not taking accountability for your part. What part should I take accountability for? For the antagonizing. Oh, I see. I antagonize you because I quipped back at you. I see. And then I ran over and got in your face and started screaming. And I did not scream. Yeah, you did. You'll see.

Well, we're about to see. So, I'll see. Yes. Yes, we will. This doesn't even involve me. And I feel like my mom's about to whoop me talking to me. Yeah. Yeah.

I swiveled it to for you to look at me, not to push it out from under you without grabbing it and you shove it. How's that a swivel? It was a push. It was a push. You're right. It was more of a push, but it wasn't It wasn't to push you off. Definitely wasn't a pull. Definitely not a pull. It was like a swivel. No, it was more like a shove. Definitely a shove. It's a different sort of force. It definitely is. Yeah, the it is different than a pull because it's the opposite motion. Yes, I agree with that. I I'm gonna find someone who knows more about physics than I do. But I'm I'm just saying I didn't shove you out. Physics thing. I wasn't going to shove you. Consult with perhaps a PhD. Mhm. I feel like it's a master. I don't feel like it's a physics thing. I feel like if your hand goes like that, it's a push. And if your hand goes like that, it's a pull. What I wanted to say like 10 minutes ago I don't have a source. What I wanted to say like 10 minutes ago, what I wanted to say a long time ago, I'm afraid I can't help you. Okay, totally fair. Reasonable. I think that it's far crazier to attack someone's character, to attack their dreams like your wife did. I can understand where her rage is coming from because I'm sure I would feel a lot of protection towards my person as well. So, I get that. But to on someone's dreams, that seems crazy to me. If we're going to talk about you should you should chat it on my dreams. Yeah, totally. I didn't mean to and I apologized as soon as I got in here. What are your dreams? Well, there was a moment in the BTS thing uh where you said like, "Wait, Mick, are you able to pull it up?" So, go to the Discord. Oh, yeah. This is I don't have a Discord.

Move your hands though. It's funny when you mock somebody. Not funny when I mock somebody. My My one dream private. My That was private. So now it's that was an intimate It doesn't matter. It was a private. It's only okay if you mock people when other people can't see it. Got it. That's why I said, "Let's go outside. We could talk about it. I'm not going to say all the me I'm not going to say mean things about you. I'm not going to on you at all." It was a private conversation about her between a man and a woman. Her hoping that I don't continue my bloodline, right? Understand about that. Fair. Fair. Oh boy. Okay, that's cool. Um, just like the double standards are endless. Wow. Uh oh. Can you read this? You're supposed to be napping, honey. Okay. Your husband said to get to bed. That's true. I did. Patriarchy wins again. Uh, wait. Okay. So, um, see, everyone's just lying. Here I'm getting into the show notes from Priscilla that we actually you know what we'll come back to Priscilla's show notes because we we had show notes for you but you know uh the whole getting kicked out thing. You're back. Welcome. Do you want to say hi? I don't know if you I said hi. Can you just You're getting cut out of frame because we're staying split primarily. So sorry honey. Oh what the I didn't mean to press. Did you say sorry honey? Well that's her name. Oh okay. Sorry. What's your honey? Yeah. Okay. Nice. Nice to meet you. Look at you. Ready to be offended. You're ready to be offended at a moment's notice. Oh, am I? Well, it I mean that's what it seemed like. I thought it was funny. Oh, so I thought he was talking to you. He said that. That's why I don't know. It seemed like he thought he was talking to you. No. So, you know, keeping in the spirit of this conversation, you said you had you wanted to add notes after your experience on the show. I already addressed the abbleist thing pretty much. Well, you wrote, "I would like Andrew and you to explain your acceptance for abbleist behavior, but not accepting other forms of bigotry." Andrew Andrew's hand gestures making fun of people with physical and mental disabilities. Wait, hold on. Are you saying that? Are you No. Why are you talking about my girl Priscilla? That's not what I said. I said meaning Priscilla, you going to let her call you mentally and physically disra? That's literally what you said, bro. I I miss tight, bro. Bro, you can't. Oh, this is what you wrote. Andrew hand gestures making fun of people with physical and mental disabilities. He was acting like they have Priscilla, let me ask you a question. No, you're making fun of actual people. I'm actually I'm actually Yeah, she made fun of you. Whatever. Priscilla for sure. Should I add something? That's not what I said. I said you're making fun of people with physical and mental disabilities. This gesture makes fun of people with physical. But are you saying that about? No. Priscilla, you going to let her say that about you? Continue reading and you'll see that it was a typo. And then Well, then you said you pretty much right off the bat laughed at me for messing up a word when I actually do have a disability that causes me to do that. Everybody's disabled. But I am. I didn't know that you were dyslexic. I I had already talked about being dyslexic at that point. I don't listen to like 70% of what the women Okay. Yeah. That's very nice. That's very nice. I'm listening. I'm kidding. But yeah, that's why I got upset. I probably missed that part though. Um, good talk. Uh, but I mean, you got upset cuz like I was like, "Oh, what did you say?" Cuz you said the like the word you used it was like fraternity, I think. Right. Fraternity. Isn't the dyslexia about reading? No. I mean, yeah, with ADHD, it's I have cognitive issues to where I tend to mess up words when I speak or write pretty often and my mind blanks and I I mess up my vocabulary very often. But that's not your dyslexia. It is dyslexia. Dyslexia is more um in depth than what you would think. Look it up. There's like a very very long list of symptoms. Even like driving is hard with dyslexia. You get directions like my brain gets all confused and stuff sometimes. Your brain gets confused. Yes, it does. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I call that being frazzled. Yeah. There's a lot of frazzling with you. I do get it. Lot lot of frazzlement. My brain doesn't always bring that correctly. Your brain isn't braining. So, did a bunch of dudes slide into your teeth? Oh, yeah. There's a lot of them. Thank you guys, by the way, for being so nice. Gross. After How long How long have you been celibate? Year and a half. You think it's like finally gonna end or uh I don't know about that? Yeah, she's self. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. A virgin. You kind of look like like from the chin up. You kind of look like a nun. Wait, did you say you're a virgin? From the chin up. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I should Oh, I was like Oh, yeah. I mean, I'd rather date like you have a nun look to you. I had a little old lady tell me at the grocery store once I looked like the statue outside of her church. So, I just I didn't have the heart to say anything but thank you and walk away. Yo, wait chat. Does she not look like she would be in a Renaissance painting? Like you have that look to you. You have the nun look. Now you got to figure out if that's a compliment. It's a compliment. It's a compliment. Uh an in either or. Okay. You just have a very sweet angelic look in the face. So, moving on. Jen, you said Andrew also trust these demons. Yeah, you don't trust. Y'all kind of went a little hard on me cuz y'all were mad about all of this situation. I don't feel like anymore. You The first thing you did was start laughing at me like I said something crazy about Did you say something wanting a family farm? You said I was a communist because I want to own land with like my No, because you were mixing up. Okay. No, I was I wasn't laughing because legit why you started laughing. You called me communist. I wanted No, that's not why. Let's like do you want to be honest about it or Yeah, sure. Okay. So, we can be honest about it. So, what happened is you said you want a farm to move away from capitalism and you're a libertarian. I I'm just talking about because the way the government is right now and we can't nobody can afford to live in this communist situation. I'd rather get out of that. Yeah, I know. But all I was doing was laughing because you were using terms which were contradictory to each other. And I would try to explain to you and I would try to explain to you why you can you can be a libertarian and be adverse to capitalism. How how I'm averse to the way the our government is like going about right now. Yeah, I get I get that. But that could mean anything. You know what I that's why I'm saying you can't use these contradictory terms is all I was saying. That's what I was laughing at. I mean, you can, but that's going to make guys like me laugh because they're contradictions. When you contradict yourself, I laugh. That's That's how I like I can't help myself. I mean, no, you you I'm not It's like you say it's like when you say, "I can fly like Superman." And then and then you go, "But you know, nobody can nobody can fly like Superman." And then of course I'm going to laugh. It's like what? It's absurd. I can want a small government and and lack of zoning all of that and not want to depend on a government where no one can afford groceries and everyone has to Yeah, that's all consistent. That so but that wasn't what you were saying. So that's is what I was saying. No, it wasn't what you were saying. Okay. Just saying. Yeah, that's not actually what what you indeed did say. So all I can do like I can't and people have a problem with it's not just women. There's just people have an issue really literally. They have an issue. Yeah. But the thing is they have an issue with the idea that I can live in their brain that I can go in their brain and explore. I can be like, "Oh, that's what they meant. No, this is what they oh this part of the brain. I'm in here now. This is what they I can't get in your brain. I can only utilize your words. And then based on the words you tell me, that's my interpretation of what you're saying. But that's not what you said. You kept calling me a communist. Yeah. Because I would get along with because you said you wanted to check out of capitalism to go live on a commune farm. That Yes, of course. I thought that sounded a lot like communism farm. It's It's a family farm. Like how is that a communal family farm? Yeah, but that's not communism. We all have jobs and we still communism until you say I want to check out of capitalism. We both have jobs. We all still have jobs. I'm still in capitalism. I don't understand. I'm just explaining to you that these are very strange terms issues with capitalism by sharing land and cost of stuff so we can actually afford to live. That's a com. That sounds a lot like if you're going to share land and you're going to share that people with a duplex. Does that mean people with a duplex or live with their parents? Is that communism? No. Just because it's on a farm. No. If you But when you make an prescription No. When you make an prescription, what I'd like to see people do is X. Right. I'm assuming that this has some type of government backing. No. I mean, why why government backing to have a farm and No, that's not what you said, though. You said that you want to see That's not what you said. You see what I mean? On the government. Let's back up. That's what I mean. Okay, hang on. Let's back up. Very concise language. So, we're not equivocating. We're not talking past each other. I actually understand what the you're talking about. What do you actually want to see concisely? What do you actually want to see happen for in the government or No, just for for my life. No, for what you when you're talking about I want to see communal farm and communal resources. What are you talking about? I want to live with people that I love and we will have we'll buy land together and then have separate parcels of land and live happily ever after. And I like farming so I'm going to use a lot of the land to farm and no one has to. Okay, that's a whole if they want to. That makes sense. But that's a whole different thing. Yeah, that's I was like, how am I a communist? All right. All right. Okay. Maybe in the future just like be super be Well, not even super concise. Just a little bit concise. You all kept calling me a chatter box and stuff for trying to explain myself. No, no, no. Do you And you started laughing before I could even do that. Okay, here I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to show you the distinction, right? So, what I would like to see is I would like to see capitalism regulated by the government. You understood that, right? But do you really? Hang on. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. You understand? Do you understand what I just said? Yeah. Okay. Here's how you would have said that. Like it's just when talk about government stuff and land the government stuff in the land. I would like to see it's like a communal you know and then and then like what we can do stop stop let me finish. And then like what we would do is uh share crop inside of loved ones and margarine hat. That's hang on. That's the distinction. Like when I tell you something, when I when I'm speaking to you, I try to be not even super concise, just at least expressing in hang on in basic terms what my worldview is so that you understand it. That's how you actually sound to us. I I get that. But I literally had just started talking and y'all were coming at me. I'd never been on a podcast before. I couldn't really speak without y'all like, you know, if it was a conversation like this, I could have articulate articulated that to you compared to y'all like coming at me like crazy. So, and just laughing at me. That's Well, to be fair, I don't think Brian laughed at you. I think I laughed at you once. No, he was like he was like, "Oh, are you are you a feminist? You'd get along with that girl." That that was his intake I mean take on all of it. So, you pro probably would get along with that girl. They're just saying probably was she want a farm, you know. Well, she wants everybody to be on a giant global farm. But yeah, um cuz she's a you know, she's a communist or honest people communist though. There was a a Marxist feminist who was here. Oh, I saw that. I watched that. Yeah. Yeah. They want they want people on like, you know, the giant communal form basically. Yeah. I don't want to do that. Yeah, probably. I I'm introverted. I'd rather just like be around people I want to be around, you know? That sounds like a great life to me. Yeah. But you can understand from my position. I can only understand words that I hear from a person. You started laughing as soon as I started saying because it was absurd. So it's laughable. I couldn't No, I couldn't explain. You started laughing before I could even explain my stance on it. I know. Well, when you're all over the place for like 30 minutes straight. Literally, that was when I had first started talking. Y'all, you came at me immediately. Well, I mean, I come at people based on what they say. What do you want me to do? If you say certain crazy I'm going to talk to you about it. You said that what I said wasn't crazy, like living with my family and stuff, but I didn't. But that's not what you said, dude. I did say. No, it's not what you said. It's really not. You know, I I know you want it to be, but it it actually just in fact was not. If y'all didn't come at me like I was crazy the moment I cuz y'all took out this girl's stuff and that other girl's stuff on me. He was annoyed. You were whatever and mood. I was fine. Well, y'all came at me. I don't take any of this personally. I never have like ever. Are you guys Oh, I'm done. What? Wait, why you looking at me? Where's my ice cream, bro? Where's my ice cream? No, I don't want I don't want an ice cream. I'm around. I don't want one. I don't want one. Brian, I just just just want to point out that I said I don't want one. You feel comfortable doing not I don't I don't I don't actually I don't actually want this This is going to bring me ice cream no matter what. Licking something. So, why did I open my mouth? I knew I like There's nothing you could do at that point, right? He's he's going to mess with me now. Yeah, you have to eat it. No, definitely. I already ate octopus on on screen. Old people can't have sugar. You know how that goes. I don't even like to eat bananas. And when I was a young person, I still couldn't have sugar. So, don't feel bad. I will be RB. This cookie cookie. No, I'm good. The chat's going to hate me for this one. You're holding it like a burrito, bro. Anybody want a popsicle? Oh, no. No. That's for That's for her, right? Give it to her. Nope. No. No. Nothing. Please. I'm good. Oh, we have a chat here that uh we're going to have come in. Uhoh. Belulu Derek donated $200. First time donator. Long time watcher. had to chime in because this Priscilla chick is the worst kind of woman you can be around. Not worth trying to explain her childlike brain. Total idiot. Yo, thank you for the $200, Dulu. Derek, what's going on down? Hey, no alcohol. No drinking. I can't. No, you you had your medications and contraindicate. Nope, you're banned. Just wait till after. Just Yeah, we're probably going to wrap it. Yeah, we're going to wrap it soon. So, um, chat, one in the chat if you prefer Priscilla, two in the chat if you prefer Desiree. Oh my god. What the heck? Wait, is that the right framing for the question? Even I prefer Priscilla over Desiree. Desire's is Desire worse than worse. I've never now that I'm thinking about. Wait, chat. No numbers. Priscilla or Desiree? Go ahead. Oh gosh. Maybe. because Desire is smarter. But that might be worse. I'm not. Now that I think about it, like they're both pretty horrible. Honestly, could you ever imagine the words Desiree is smarter coming out of your mouth, Andrew? I couldn't have until just a few moments ago. But that was a worldview shift. She's going to post that. Yeah, she's gonna post on her Only Fans or some He's coming back. He's just getting a smoke. Yeah. All right, guys. Um, we're gonna probably do like a bit of a rose session in a or maybe not. I don't know. We'll see. Um, thank you, Seth. Chair one, heavy eye contact with the camera while you You're getting blocked by the microphone. This is the camera right here. What the are you doing, Seth? What are you doing? What do you mean? What am I doing? You gave this to me. I'm eating a I'm eating a cookie. There's no weird It is weird. I don't know how to eat a popsicle on camera. It's making me nervous. That's exactly why I say I'd have one later. Like, yeah, I don't even like to eat bananas in front of people. It's awkward. Oh, it's like I take little pieces off of it, you know? How does it make you feel, Brian, when you eat a popsicle on camera? It's less awkward. I mean, I don't do it. Is this degrading? What do you mean? Are you degrading me right now? What? Yeah, he is. The the chat's probably like, "Oh, yeah. being a gracious host offering my guest kindly giving me podcast snack. Thank you. I appreciate it. You're just going I was smart enough not to do it. So, just saying. What are you implying? They're going to like Oh, no. People will subscribe to my Only Fans.

I should probably be in front. you kept getting on me for interrupting you, but then y'all were interrupting me and acting like a Karen before letting me even finish my statements. I also don't don't agree that I'm backpedaling for giving context and sit. Well, that's a different thing. Um, you're kind of interrupting a little bit. Yeah, that that whole I was I wasn't I'm doing it now. Whatever. So yeah, when that thing about I was talking to you about um business stuff, I wasn't I was like mids sentence when I brought up Brian and you and you were like Brian, you hear this and you you like laughed and like said something that was like not what I was getting at at all because you interrupted me like mid-sentence, started laughing and told him that I was like saying he didn't work hard, which is not the case at all. Oh. Oh yeah. Wait, really quick, Mick. I'm sorry. This is not related. Can you go to the Discord and go to the research tab in the Discord? I got something for Priscilla. No, no, no. Okay. Uh, in the Discord, do you have the Discord open? Do you patience. You have the Discord open. Okay. So, in the left side there's different like there's the behind the scenes tab there's a research tab which it's going to be below a couple below the behind the scenes tab. Do you see it?

Would you And then put it back on now. Boom. Would you date the male version of yourself? See, what's funny is I love men so much that it's even clear as a man, I also love men. So, if I was a man, I would be gay. So, I wouldn't So, female Priscilla wouldn't have a chance. Oh, wait. No, like you as a woman right now, would you date that male version of you? He wouldn't give me a chance. He wouldn't give you a chance. Yeah, cuz he'd be gay. But like you would you would give him a chance is what you're saying. Like I get he's gay. I have a history of dating gay dating gay guys. Okay, I see. I see. There was something. Could you pull that back up real quick? Wait, that's like You know what, Chad? Tell me if this sounds right. Can you tell that I'm good? This is like the the one on the left. That's like Attack on Titan meets can't be within 500 yards of an elementary school. I mean, you know what I mean, chat? Do you know what I I mean, no. Am I I'd No, I think he looks like Oh, I like Attack on Titan, but not the No, I thought the other one was The other one's pretty They're both pretty good. I I see the girl on the left and I think how could anyone be mean to that precious angel? We we put that through AI and a couple filters. I know. I'm just saying still because they know that that angel can go from zero to psycho in 4.2. We we were doing a lot of favors. Okay. We did a lot of favors on the the one in the picture. There's some AI tools used, some highlighting done, mid tones. We boosted the mid tones. Did the faith a bit of smoothening? Why you looking at me that way, Seth? Wait, what are you saying? What are you saying? What are you saying? What? You hate what? Well, you're a racist. What did you say? Huh? Okay. She did agree to to the immigration stuff, so racism there. And she does live in Tucson. Is that a border? Yes. You should probably She even said most of the people around hate. I didn't see. She said most of the people around hate in the birds out hating the illegals. I'm just saying. Yeah. But there are also illegals there in Tucson, right? That's true. Lots of She does own a firearm though, so I think we're many. Well, he's Yeah, she needs them where she's at. No, you need it now. Ever since Imagine the Whatever podcast. See, now if we would send the army down there, you wouldn't need firearms no more. I'm just pointing that out. I don't have firearms specifically for illegal immigrants, but thank you, Wrath. Appreciate it. Uh, we have a chat here from Spyro, uh, Wrath PSA. Thank for the gifted 20 subs over there on Twitch, guys. Go to twitch.tv/ whatever. Drop us a follow and a prime sub. Uh, what the heck? What the heck? Sorry, I'm waiting. Oh, I already played it. Okay. Spyro says Brian giving Mick instructions. Open up the fridge. Yes, that fridge. Do you see it? No. To the left. Do you see it? No. To the left. No, that's taco. Not the taco. The burrito. Scroll. Scroll back. For sakes. F. Oh man. That's the 50K minus. What the was that You know it is. Was that me? Was that direct audio of me? That was definitely you. This is like internal Brian. Um, okay. Let me get through the notes. We have uh I think wait is that it from from our homie Jen uh the interrupting you said you also don't agree that you're about the backpedaling uh oh you don't appreciate being called sexist for basing your man and bear answer based off statistics and you wrote you're more likely to be killed by a mosquito than a bear. You're more likely to be killed by a dog. Uh more likely to be killed by a bee than a bear. You're more likely to be killed by a certain species of snail than a bear. Bear are the second most deadly animal on the planet. No, that was a typo typo. That's fine. I meant uh men. Wait, bears are the No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That that was a typo. What I meant was uh um men are the second most deadly. The second you wrote uh mosquitoes are the most deadly animal. And then and then it's man. Oh, okay. So, yeah, that was a typo. Something on the planet is way f Oh, bears are way further down on the list. Yeah, there's all type of uh before you looked at the statistic. Okay. And you said mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are the deadliest. Yeah, that's because of malaria. Oh, I know. But if you look at a list like there's bears are like on way at the bottom because of encounter rates. It's per still. But still statistics. I mean, wait. Question. Why would I if I got a question for you. If everybody else here left the room, everybody else here left the room and you were in here alone and we just pumped the the room full of a million mosquitoes. You can pick or we drop in like I get it. We drop in like three bears. Which do you pick? You pick the mosquitoes or the bears? I would pick the mosquitoes because if you drop in some bears, of course they're going to be in attack mode because they'd be like, "What the fuck?" Well, then you just kind of negated your own argument there. No. No. Because bears if um if you surprise them, they're more likely to attack. And if if you drop me in another country that has malaria. Yeah. But your argument here that that you stated was that this thing is more deadly than a bear. Men are more deadly than bears. Bees are more deadly than bears, etc., etc. But when applied, when situationally applied, you still even understanding that mosquitoes, one million of them, the potential that one has malaria is pretty high is probably pretty high, right? Well, in the US, it's not high. Hang on. Hang on. But we're in the US. Hang on. So anyway, you said forest you would pump you would you would still prefer that over three bears dropped in which means that just because men are uh deadlier as far as they kill more than bears do human beings, right? And mosquitoes kill more than men do. You still would prefer the more deadly species of mosquito over bears. And this is saying this is just showing you like the context of the situation. If you drop bears in, they're going to be in attack mode automatically because they're going to be freaked out. Like, let you know if you're teleporting bears in a room. I tell you what, we'll give you a tranquilizer gun for the bear situation. Well, no. I mean, what if you give me beads from a different country? I mean, uh, but we're in mosquitoes, right? So, like mosquitoes. That wasn't in the question. You said random. I mean, yeah, in my list, I'm just listing all of the animals like I mean, I wasn't Yeah, you said in the woods, random mosquito in the woods, ran a bear. Um, yeah. I mean, do you want to compare that to every animal I listed, like the snails or what? It just seems a bit like of a disingen disingenuous example to give that m like mosquitoes are more deadly. I don't think it actually is. I'm just saying I based it off statistics. It's because they're disease carriers because Oh, I know that. Right. That was just one of the several things. I mean, I could send you the entire list of animals that are more deadly. Um, if you said drop me in the water with a hippo, I'd be like, or a man, right? But I would say I would be a man, right? But I guess it would even if the the the mosquitoes we pumped into this room carried malaria, I'm actually confident that you would all of them had malaria and it's almost assured that you would cap you would get malaria. I would not want malaria. Would you ra but if or dropped if they were dropped in this room or what? They're dropped in this room and you got to stay in the room for 5 minutes and then you can leave. I only have one like tranquilizers. Mind you, malaria can be treated, but Oh, I mean, if they're dropped in No, I I would I would shoot I would Okay, remove. How many people die from malaria? You don't get the tranquilizer. Oh, then I mean I'd choose the mosquitoes. Mosquitoes. Even with malaria, I would choose the mosquitoes. How about this? Let me ask you a different way. Uh, would you rather be in a in a a jail cell with a bear or with another man for 10 minutes? A man. Okay. What about a cage? a man. How about this? That's the same thing. You're at the top of a burning building. Well, maybe not the burning building. Uh, wait, I forgot how to jump. I don't know how there's going to help me. We're both kind You're You're at the top of a burning building. There's one stairwell that you can make your exit through. Uh, do you go and the stairwell can either have a man in it or a bear in it? I mean, the man There's not really a way to escape. I mean, I'm just basing it off the situation you gave me in the in the woods, you know. But so your your objection to it, though, is that you said it was bad faith for you to go around using such a horrendous Wait, hold on. Hold on. Wait, hold on. You said that it was bad faith for me to go around using such a horrendous term about you like that for using statistics. No, it's not either because here and I'll show you why. And the term is sexist. I'll actually show you. That's what I said. Yeah, but I'll actually show you why this isn't a good argument and I'll do it really easy. Would you rather spawn in a forest with a man or a bear? You said a man because Oh, spawning would be different than You said come across as different. Even come across. I said I said man. I mean, I said bear. Yeah, bear. Exactly. Okay. Would you rather come across in a forest a black man or a white man? Um, either. But I What about statistics? Um I don't know if them is are they? Uh okay. I don't know the statistics on that. Do I? Do I? I'm just saying like if you just want to move off of statistics, right? I didn't look at the statistics ahead of time on that. Did Okay. So So if if one was more dangerous, would you pick that one over the other one? No. I No. No. You don't want to sound racist, do you? No. I mean No. I mean, if you show me the statistics, then I'll say that one. I mean, okay, it is what it is. Just just pointing that out. It's just so that that's and you can make those statistical arguments back is my point, right? So, you got to be got to be cautious with that. That's all I'm saying. What's your answer to that? I mean, you use statistics all the time in your argument. I'd rather be stuck in a forest with a white guy or a black guy. Yeah. What is your answer? Wait. Me? You? Which one would I rather be? Yeah. With stuck in. Stuck with. Oh, with Yeah. Probably a white guy. Okay. Yeah. What? Uh oh. Yeah. What's wrong with that? I like What's wrong with that? It's just kind of it's crazy to assume not knowing anything about either person that we're just going off of I thought we're just going off of statistics for like which one's more dangerous or something towards women though I I would have to look up well towards men and women in this case for me as a woman I I would have to look up um yeah because I think murders for black guys are mostly black on black And white guys are the ones that are killing. Still more dangerous. Yeah. But not not towards women though. I don't know. I'd have to more dangerous towards women too. I don't know. Statistically. Just saying. Yeah. Serial killers, PDF files, and school shooters, all white people. I'd have to look that up. Are you saying for the whole world? No. The if the listen here's the idea the idea is just this that is true. Would you rather be spawned in a forest with a bear or a man? The idea is women who pick man say because man more dangerous right than bear because man can envision like horrible things that he wants to do and the bear won't then maybe the bear will run off or this or that. It's like ah I see. So then you can even reduce that down again. Okay. Well then what type of man? What if it was this type of man or that type of man? And generally you get a disingenuous answer from the person because they don't want to tell you the truth somehow then which is very bizarre. Just saying. Well, I'd have to look up black on white. Yeah, that's fine. We we won't we won't linger on it. I'm just pointing it out. What about what if you were confronted with a woman and we changed it? Like would you rather be confronted by like a woman or a bear type thing? What do you mean? Would you rather open up to a tree? You mean would I rather spawn with a with a woman or a bear or like would you rather come across a bear or a woman? Women. A a woman. A woman. And that's and that's really easy, right? But there's tons of women that would choose the bear. You're kidding. No, I'm just saying like which one I'm just saying because one is scarier to come across, right? I don't think anyone would choose the the bear and if it was between bear and woman because women are kind of well I think most women still would actually choose man if they thought about it for a second but they don't think they usually think about it very much they just kind of do a knee-jerk reaction though just saying and all of a sudden by the way here's why I know it's disingenuous the answer from most women is because suddenly every woman who answers this question is a hiking forest genius Somehow they're like, "Oh, I've been camping my entire I've been camping my entire life and I I know how to do all sorts of survivalist stuff." And then then when I press them on what survivalism they know, guess how much they actually know? Nothing. Nothing. You do? Huh? Yeah. Yeah. You're a survivalist, are you? I mean, not an expert, but yeah, a little bit. Do you have a go bag or a bugout bag? Yeah. Do you have a I keep one in my car. See what I mean? emergencies. That's what I mean, right? They're all survivalist. Rations. Do you like stock rations? Oh, no. I want to like I've got I need to build mine up. I got like a I got a weak supply. It should be more. It should be more. Oh, yeah. I I want more. Needs more. Actually, I just moved so I don't really have anything like that. But that is my goal to have. You got you got a setup like in case I mean I'm in Texas. There's hurricanes and crap. Like we deal with all that stuff all the time. So, you kind of have to have all of those resources. Yeah. You know, Andrew, it's great talking about We should start a survival show. You and me, Dude, I'll be on it. Do you have with bears? Do you have a setup in the forest with bears? Andrew's got a plan. Boys versus girls. Hit the fan. Like, you have a bugout bag. Let's see who can survive longer. Me versus you. I bet I could. I doubt that. Let's do it. We'll get a lot of views. Where are we putting you guys? I'll tell you what then. But there has to be bears. Wait, let's do this. There has to be bears in the forest. Let's do it, right? We're going to put them there. You if I mean I think California has black die. Is that what you're saying? Well, no. I mean, we can have No, we have to die in the forest. There there has to be some sort of prize or something. And Oh, I thought you me like do it like a survival show. If we die, we die. Oh, no. See who uh like Oh, I can't get water. Yes, I'm dead. No, let's see who can survive. Like you can tap out. see who can survive in the wilderness. I thought it was a situation where like oh I wasn't able to get like drinking water and then like I'm over here with my camera like I'm over here with my I'm poisoned with my like primo water just pounding it and you're like Brian can I have some? I'm like sorry but here's the rules. Man first and let's do it. Y'all first the the Yeah, we go in different parts of the forest. We just get a knife that's it. Yeah, we can agree on on whatever sort a knife or maybe we can pick like Wait, hold on. Let me I would rather an axe. Can we Can we make it a knife? Hold on. A knife and a loin cloth is fair. The naked thing. I don't want to be naked and afraid. I was watching Apocalyptto yesterday. No, we can make money off of this and I can prove that I actually do know survival stuff and they can prove that they're all big and manly. So, would you eat the endtrails of a squirrel? You saw me eat an octopus on the freaking That is I've eaten bugs. So, yeah. I I did. You ready? I mean, you already lost the bet on on the hundred bucks. So, what? Let's bet on this or like do some sort of show. I would love to. Mhm. That would, you know, I You would get a lot of views on that wanting to produce a series like the survival show. It's been done already, but like we put a group of men on an island and some women on an island, but instead of like it's feminists on the island. Oh god. So it's not even like survival chicks. Do I count as a feminist? I think so. So I want to be on it. Ogle, are you watching this? Do you want to be a executive producer on my We need funding for this cuz islands are funding. Stop buying champagne for a bit and just put it into the funding of this of the show. Feminists, you know, feminists. There should be a winning prize. ice cream in case they decide to Sorry, what you you we need like a winning prize or something. Okay. So, what So, let me ask you this, right? A winning prize and and this is funded on this side of it. What do you bring to the table? So, that y'all are getting money too from views. Yeah, but what do you get? What do you bring for the state? Okay. I want to say that they're paying for it, not you. It's much more fun to watch watch the ladies. Ladies, it's great. That brings a lot of viewers in general. a lot more viewers than this and you're getting paid through that. Great television. I do my own content when there's no women around. Well, this is I bet this would get a lot more views than that. Bring some food though. That is true. Occasionally beer and off camera. You wouldn't be funny. She's wearing a burka for all we know. Yeah, probably. You know, I was thinking about Never mind. Are you an I would love to do this. It sounds fun. What do you What do you like? What beer? Um, I like piss water beer. Sometimes he slums it and drinks a bud. Didn't you say you don't even like hiking? So, I mean, I think that I Yeah, that is Are you going to be in this? Cuz I feel like it's not fair if you don't survive. I'm just going to I'm a I'm executive producing. That's not fair. Why is that not fair? So, it's like me versus you. That's what you wanted 5 seconds ago. Yeah. Okay, fine. Let's do it. That'd be a vacation for me. I don't know what you're talking about. It's got to be a ton of girls. Well, then it needs to be a ton of guys then, right? Yeah. Yeah, we can think of the all of it later. But I would love to do that. Sounds great. But there has to be bears to make it fair. Do it on Channel Island. This is like the ninth circle of hell, Brian. This is the night circle of hell. It is. It is. So, what do you guys um think about?

You're insane. Don't forget to play the recording of the police reaching out to you. remember Priscilla don't believe didn't believe that you received the call. Brian, thank for the super chat. I don't know if it's really necessary to play it, but maybe we should. I don't think Andrew is actually upset. It's just that in principle, he's not willing to let you off the hook because as he said, a man would have been subject to a different set of circumstances for the same behavior. Correct. And you would have treated a man differently too, I think. Yeah. But don't you understand that? Like even if I granted that that was true, so what? It still would not make your point. I just want to say it still wouldn't help your point. Like not even a little bit. I agreed that we I agreed that we both did something wrong. No, you did something wrong. We both did. No, you did. So did you. Disappointed. Donated $30 just to let you know how he felt. Yeah. That you did something wrong. No, that was for you. No, that was for you about antagonizing others. Should we bring that back up? Bring it back up, Ryan. Bring what the the antagonizing disappointed spent $30. I didn't saying that the Bible. You might have just imagined that. I don't remember that.

Thank you, Brandon, for the TTS. Hasty George donated $30. Profilla, you really hurt my feelings when you put down my PP. I'll have you know that I have a huge 4 and a half incher. Wow. Very respectful. That's funny. Honestly, good to know, George. Proud of you. Good for you. I am proud of you. Uh, wait. So, going into the notes here, Priscilla, you said that uh the show has misogynistic undertones and implications. And I think that that's I had that those in your notes before you came on last time. I don't remember. Or you came on the show with Sav and then you sent me these notes. So, but you got kicked off so we didn't get to get into it. So, the show has misogynistic undertones and implications. How do you define misogyny? Misogyny is when men have general contempt for women. Okay, I'll accept that. So, um, what are the misogynistic undertones and implications pertaining to the show or things I say or Andrew says or Sap says? So when you I think some of the things you don't know that it's happening because you can only see it from a male perspective. But did you just assume my gender? Go on. I don't want to be that is what I truly believe. That's why I said that. Like I'm not to be um undermining or anything, but I mean I do think like for example like I think it would be like if I were to have men come into a podcast in a similar way and I was the host and I was just like how much money do you make? Do you think that? And just started saying a bunch of stereotypes for men like do you think do you think like the view I have not seen it. But yeah, like the C I do want to say that both I don't think that the I can understand how you guys are both pushing back, but I do think it's extremes. Like there's feminist push back to to your extreme and then your extreme to the feminist push back. And it just feels very hateful on both sides. Like I don't understand when women hate men and I don't understand when men hate women. Do we hate women? That's what I feel. I don't know if you hate them, but I feel like you have content. You feel you feel that we hate women. It seems that it's been displayed that you have general contempt because I don't think Okay. I don't think that having judging people for their life choices has anything to do with dating in general. I think it's just to knock down their character. Yeah. But that's personal. What? No, it's not personal. It's the idea is if you're having a dating podcast, then there's people have all sorts of preferences when it comes to dating. Because they have all sorts of preferences when it comes to dating, they're going to take things into account like body count, your sex life, your sexual past, you're going to make all sorts of judgments. That's going to be out in the open that you're and you're talking about those things. So, only when you're romantically involved. Otherwise, it's not anyone's business. Yeah. But the whole point of it is to discuss what people are interested in when it comes to romantic involvement. And so you're getting people's stories, what it is that they're talking about, what it is that they're discussing. They make all sorts of value judgments about us. We make value judgments about them. Everybody makes value judgments about everybody because that's how the human experience operates. We make value judgments about each other all the time, non-stop, every day, all the time. But then the best way to deal with that is to say, okay, I don't want somebody that does A B C. I don't want this. So then you don't pick that person. But but to say that it has to be this way or that way for someone, it's not not everyone has the same standards. We're not saying they do, right? So it doesn't matter your body count really. It doesn't matter. It doesn't follow at all. So like so here maybe it matters to you. This person doesn't want me. Why? And then they say because A, B, and C. And then you ask the person, well why is that? Why is that that you wouldn't want a person like this? And then they're going to give their reasons. And then other people are going to push back against that because maybe they think the reasons are bad. This is just a simple value judgement, value assessment that everybody has, right? We we can all decide what is appropriate and what our expectations are, but it's different for every person. Like I some men might care about the body count, some men might not, some men might not in dispute, right? Okay. Like that's literally not in dispute. I agree. There's got to be at least some men out there who don't care about body count. I agree. No dispute. And I don't think preferences of any kind are bad. Like it's all personal. I think there's some bad preferences. Yeah. Like if you want to ddle kids, that's a pretty bad preference. I was going to say pretty bad preference. No, for your partner. Smoker's cough. Like I don't think any preferences for your partner are bad. Like what if you wanted your partner to be 16? That seems pretty bad. That's way different though. No, it's just a it's a preference, right? It's just a really bad preference. Well, that's that's illegal versus legal. Like, yeah, but what does that have to do with pref? Like, if it was illegal to have sex doggy style, I assume people would still do it, isn't it? In some states. Sure. And I assume people in those states. No, I think anoles. Isn't that sodomy? I think even the UCMJ had has a sexual morality code, the uniform code of military justice. But I'm just saying pretty confident soldiers still do that, right? Yeah. So, and the legality of the thing really has nothing to do with the preference of what you want to do, right? But we would just objectively say some things are just bad preferences and wrong and we don't want them and they need to go away because we don't prefer them and I don't prefer any preferences but mine. Therefore, mine should be legislated forever and everybody should follow them at all times. Okay. Yeah, that's Christian nationalist viewpoint. Well, I mean, that's just the viewpoint of subjective morality, right? Uh, I'm going to do some Venmo Cash App shoutouts because a couple came through. Uh, Randy, thank for the five on Venmo. Joseph, thank for the hundred on Cash App. He says, for insert, thumbs up for all of chat. Thank you, Joseph, for the hundred on Venmo.

I haven't watched that many of them, but I'm sure I've said hateful things I would disagree. I've said hateful things towards a woman, not hateful things towards women. True, true.

Also, Edward Furlong with a wig is not fooling me in chair three. By the way, there's still another hour. Um, but if you wanna Are you serious? No. No. What I'm saying is like you're not you're not going to miss In and Out before it closes. But I'm wrapping this. I'm wrapping this. There's one last note for Priscilla if you want to do that. And Oh, no. I thought you said we're going another hour. Like what? Oh, no. No. I was saying uh there's another In-N-Out's open for another Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's all good. Yeah. There's just like two more things and then um but Brian sometimes two things and I'm okay with this normally. Sometimes two things turns into six things turns into eight things and I'm fine with that normally but if I don't get the in and out tonight he's hangry you know you're going to get it. Yeah, you're going to get it. Um it is true though. It is true. I'm like 10 more minutes and it's two hours later. It's two hours later. I know. Um Priscilla, you said in your notes you think focusing so much on looks is toxic. because that was our big disagreement. The whole rating one to 10 thing. Let's go around the table. What do you rate your looks on a scale of 1 to 10? I'm not playing that game. I've seen those clips. There's no right answer. What do you mean? Wait. I mean, there is actually a right answer. There is a right answer. What is it? Well, the truth. We would Yeah, the truth. Actually, that's usually the right answer. You don't play that game. I think looks are subjective. Just because I may say, "Oh, I think I'm this number." There's obviously going to be people who disagree with me. into there's obviously going to be people who disagree with me and that's totally fine but I'm not playing you can't pick seven 100% completely don't disagree with you all looks are subjective based on the you the person right so from your subjective view you the person what do you rate yourself just on pure looks oh my god oh I'm not answering the question I'm not Why? Cuz the same thing happens every single time that what that happens on this podcast. What happens? You question my answer. No, actually we usually don't question most women's answer. Oops. We only question it like Yeah. So like if there's a like a literal land whale perhaps who uh managed to blow hole its way into the studio and then says, "I'm a 10. I'm an objective 10." Uh we might give a bit of push back on that but generally speaking um not really like we don't really give too much push back on. I have here watch check this out. What do you rate your looks on a scale of 1 to 10? 11. Six. Not biting the bait. I would choose seven. You should bite the bait though because you didn't say all that much on the podcast. So you this is your opportunity. I know there was you a lot of things about this podcast that are a lot different than I thought. Not in a bad way. Not dogging you. We believe in you. Believe in you. Will we will we move on so we can all go eat if I give you a number? Boundaries are bad. Nine. Do you mean that though? Yeah. I don't know. I feel like you're lying and now we have to drag the show on. So I have a lot of confidence. I couldn't do what I do for a living if I didn't have confidence realistically. So, is it confidence or hubris? I'd accept either. It's self love. Pride, ego. Um, oh yeah. Is it um what is it? Makeup wipes. They look like she's wearing makeup. I have to look at the ingredients first. I have allergies. Oh. Oh, that's the allergies. If I come back on the show, I'm going to bring back a good a good one. That doesn't cause women. It did make me break out. I won't lie. Allergies to the wipes, but not the makeup. No, we're everyone says you need like the mellar water or whatever it's called. I'll bring you some water. It's like a It's a And you use paper towel and No, it doesn't. Yeah. Priscilla is a 10. Wait, Priscilla, tell us a guy who's a 10. Um, no, she said she's an 11. Well, I I do think it's wrong to to care about looks. So, but you you're just saying like a very handsome man in general. Anyone that you think is a 10? A guy who you think is a 10. like but uh name somebody who's like a famous or celebrity so people can see because if you say oh Bobby from the 7-Eleven wait guys just if you can just be quiet you guys have any celebrity no who do you who like think of a celebrity that you think is a 10 male celebrity I don't know I've gone through phases like I used to think Mario Lopez was really attractive when he did Save by Bell. Okay. Young Mario Lopez in the 90s or whatever. And now he's still a good looking guy. What else? Also, Orlando Bloom is a 10. He's pretty attractive, too. Okay, so Orlando Bloom and Mario Lopez. I think those are good jumping off points. Do you think that's Is the Discord still up, Nick? Oh, like do do we is that compar do you think that they're equal for men and looks as you are? When you say that you're an 11, do you think that that you're in the same league as those guys? These are also men that wear makeup, too. Great. But anyway, so are I that's the question would still stand, right? I think that they would like me. Okay, good talk. Mario Lopez. No, no, no. If they're married, I'm sorry. I just want to say that's bad. So, they wouldn't want me because they're married, I'm pretty sure. Wait, so question for you. Who's a guy that you think is a nine? Um, embarrassing answer. Matthew Grey Goobler from Criminal Minds. Who the is that guy? You've never seen Criminal Minds? No. Is there somebody more famous that comes to mind? I gave you an answer. Matthew. Look, you don't want Mickar some You gotta give me somebody I can picture. No offense, Nick. Mick, Johnny Depp when he was young. Brad Pitt, what do you rate Brad Pitt? Oh, this is good. What do you rate Brad Pitt? Like young Brad Pitt? Young Brad Pitt. Yeah. Um, you know, what do you rate young Brad Pit? Holy Just cuz I don't think he's attractive doesn't mean he's kind. Wait, hold on. Type young. Just not my type, that's all. He's not ugly. I'm so sorry that upset you so much. I'm very upset right now. What would you rate him? Young Brad Pitt. I mean, people like looks maxer types are going to disagree because of the epicanthal tilder or some Uh Brad, young Brad Pitt is like a 10. Eight, nine to me. Probably a 10. Okay. He's at least a nine. He's Yeah. You think young Brad So you're a nine at all. You're a nine. Brad Pitt couldn't get her. Brian Brad. Young Brad Pitt couldn't get Yeah. She's She's out of his league. Dating down. She's dating them sixes. She would be settling for young Brad Pitt. Yeah. Yeah. She'd be settling. Yeah. That's a reach. Well, you That's why I don't like this game. Well, wait. If you say you're nine, he's a six. Then you would be settling. Okay. Just Just saying. Like that would be how that would work, right? That is That is how this game works, isn't it? Yeah. It's a fun game, bro. I try to not play. I got peer pressured. Can I say that's why it's bad to focus on looks? Because saying dating down or dating up, that doesn't make sense cuz we're all way more complex than just what we are on the outside. Mhm. Yeah. I believe you when you're dating like a hunchback with half his face melted off and you can see his teeth and he only has one eye and terrible hygiene, right?
